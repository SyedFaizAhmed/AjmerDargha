                        Blessing Of Islam

                        “Say to My servants that they should only say those things that are best. For Satan doth sow
                        dissension among them. For Satan is to man an avowed enemy.” (Quran XVII: 53)

                        According To The Muslim Faith, When the Almighty God created Adam (the father of the human
                        progeny) out of a lump of clay, and commanded the angels to greet him with a ‘Sijda’
                        (prostration in humility), Ibless the Satan hesitated to obey and accept Adam as his superior
                        because he claimed his own superiority over Adam by virtue of his age long devotion to God and
                        creation out of fire. His reluctance to obey and bow before Adam, however, resulted in his
                        condemnation and he was therefore, eternally banished from the pleasure of God. Under this great
                        humiliating disappointment, the Satan, however, pleaded with God that he and his progeny (the
                        Satan belongs to the progeny of the genii) may be granted an everlasting opportunity to mislead
                        mankind into error and sin in order to test the devotion of Adam and his progeny to God. This
                        request was granted by the Almighty God with the commandment that whosoever followed the Satan’s
                        path will forfeit His pleasure and that his abode will be in the fire of hell eternally. To
                        accept either of the two options for the creation Adam and his progeny, would not have been in
                        the best interests of mankind just like illness and health, blindness and clear vision, night
                        and day, heat and cold, good and evil, and so on.

                        The first treacherous act of Satan under this arrangement started with the beguilement of Adam
                        himself in the well known episode of Eve and the “forbidden fruit” which resulted in the
                        banishment of both Adam and Eve from the heavenly paradise as a punishment against God’s
                        pleasure and thus the treachery of Satan, the avowed enemy of the progeny of Adam, has continued
                        throughout the ages causing perpetual misery among the best majority of those people who succumb
                        to his mischievous allurements in defiance of the commandments of God.

                        In this respect there are two kinds of people in the world, those who follow the commandants of
                        God, and those who are susceptible to the beguilement of Satan. There has always been a mighty
                        struggle between the followers of Satan and the believers of God ever since the creation of Adam
                        in which the latter have always vanquished the former

                        Islam And Sufism > Blessing Of Islam > Injunction Of Islam

                        According to the Holy Quran, those who follow the Satan’s enticement are rebels of God. They
                        will have to render an account of their misdeeds and sins on the Day-of-Reckoning and suffer
                        punishment in hell for they acted against the pleasure of God, but those who defy Satan and
                        stick steadfastly to the path of Righteousness and Truth as ordained in the Holy Quran and
                        preached by Prophet Mohammed, are promised salvation and eternal bliss in paradise. This is one
                        of the principal articles of faith in Islam.

                        Islam And Sufism > Blessing Of Islam > Retribution

                        The pages of the history and all religious books of the world are full of the terrible stories
                        of God’s retribution upon those past rebellious generations of mankind who defied the teachings
                        of His Prophets and apostles under the mischievous influence of Satan. There have also been
                        numerous bloody wars between the forces of evil and good, Truth and falsehood, the followers of
                        Satan and the devotees and believers of the Almighty God in which the latter few have always
                        vanquished the over -whelming many. As stated above again and again God has sent His Prophets
                        and apostles to all races and nations of the world in order to warn and keep them on the right
                        path of Truth. As it happened, after their death people forgot their sacred lessons and became
                        victims of Satan’s treachery only to forfeit the pleasure of God and earn His retribution. This
                        is a divine decree which no civilisation or modern progress can change in spite of all our
                        scientific and material advancement.

                        Islam And Sufism > Blessing Of Islam > The Holy Prophet Mohammed

                        When the holy Prophet of Islam Hazrat Mohammed (May peace and blessing of God be upon his soul)
                        appeared on the scene of Arabia in 750 AD, Satan had virtually established his devilish kingdom
                        over the Arabs who were steeped into abysmal ignorance and sin.

                        What was the actual condition of Arabia before the birth of holy Prophet Mohammed? According to
                        the holy Quran, “It was on the verge of fiery abyss.” The barbarous Arabs were completely
                        submerged under the evil influence of Satan. They were soaking in superstition, ignorance,
                        cruelty and idolatry and were torn asunder by internecine feuds and wars. They had no settled
                        government and lived a nomadic life. Wine, women and every kind of vice and crime summed up
                        their general attitude towards life. Even the Jews and the Christians had forgotten the
                        teachings of their Prophets Moses and Jesus, and had become idolaters. Writing about the
                        condition of Christianity in the 7th century was itself decrepit and corrupt. It was disabled by
                        contending schisms and had substituted the peculiarities of superstition of the pure and
                        expansive faith of the early ages.”

                        The teachings of the Prophet of Islam, however wrought a dynamic transformation in the sinful
                        life of the Arabs within only a few years despite all the worst type of oppression, insults and
                        persecution by the evil forces of Satan in order to stick to their devilish ways of life. But,
                        in spite of all these obstacles, Prophet Mohammed succeeded and succeeded triumphantly in
                        completely routing the forces of Satan and religion of Peace and Prosperity happiness of the
                        whole world as well.

                        Islam And Sufism > Blessing Of Islam > Purpose Of Islam

                        The true purpose of religion is that human beings should follow the right path according to
                        divine teachings. But before asking people to follow these teachings, it is first necessary to
                        explain the teachings and whose teaching they are: secondly, about the one who is preaching
                        them, and finally, the great benefit that will be derived by following them. These are the
                        fundamentals on which religions are formed. To have a comparative study of Islam in the light of
                        the teachings found in other sacred books, is to know what a comprehensive world religion Islam
                        is pointing out also how the author of such a religion was decidedly the last great Prophet,
                        there being consequently no further necessity at all for another Prophet to rise. Quran is the
                        final revealed Book of God and Mohammed is the last Prophet.

                        Islam And Sufism > Blessing Of Islam> Islam – An Ancient Religion

                        As a matter of fact, Islam which means peace and which represents the Divine Code for a
                        disciplined, contented and harmonious life of man on earth already existed in one or the other
                        form long before the advent of the Holy Prophet Mohammed. It however needed a revival in an up
                        to date form because due to individual and political intrigues, certain abuses had crept into
                        it. The preceding generations had altered the true spirit and version of the former Holy
                        Scriptures to suit their own selfish ends and conveniences. Thus mutilating the original
                        commandments of God and bringing an ugly slur on the fair name of Religion. These unauthorised
                        intrusions and mutilations therefore necessitated up to date ‘divine code’ in its pristine glory
                        and that is why a final and perfect religion in the form of Islam was revealed through the Holy
                        Quran and Prophet Mohammed with the explicit warning that no more Prophets were to come after
                        him. Islam is therefore, a perfect religion for all humanity and for all time, and not for the
                        Muslims alone, whether the world accepts this divine claim or not.

                        Unlike the past, Islam is now preserved in its up to date perfection in the Holy Quran and
                        because the past generations proved themselves incapable of preserving the original commandments
                        of God in theory and true perspective had, as stated above, tampered with them to suit their own
                        intriguing conveniences, therefore the Almighty Allah promised in the Quran to be its preserver
                        Himself this time. One of the living instances of this jealous guardianship is that millions of
                        Muslims easily commit this ‘Book of God’ to memory- a feature unique in its own way which is
                        nothing short of a miracle. There is no instance in the living memory of mankind to show that
                        any of the ancient religious books or any other kind of book of such a voluminous nature as the
                        Holy Quran is, was ever committed to memory. This fact alone proves that God’s original words
                        have been preserved as He willed, and that there have been no tampering whatever with them after
                        the death of the Holy Prophet Mohammed through whom the Quran was delivered

                        Islam And Sufism > Blessing Of Islam > Unique Virtues Of Islam

                        There are many unique virtues of Islam and its holy Prophet as compared with his predecessors.
                        While the preceding Prophets were endowed with only one ‘divine’ virtue to help them to make
                        their mission successful, Prophet Mohammed had the exclusive distinction of possessing all those
                        ‘divine’ virtues in him which were bestowed upon his predecessors individually. For instance,
                        Prophet Mohammed was endowed with the exemplary patience granted to Prophet Ayub, the miraculous
                        virtues possessed by the ‘staff’ given to Prophet Moses, the healing spell possessed by Prophet
                        Jesus, the perfect human beauty bestowed upon Prophet Yusuf and the supreme faith owned by
                        Prophet Abraham.

                        Further, no Prophet ever since the creation of Adam, had the unique distinction of being
                        succeeded by illustration saints and divines among his followers as the Prophet of Islam had a
                        venerable line of religious teachers and saints who shunned all pomp and show of the material
                        world in order to serve the cause of Islam and humanity selflessly and faithfully. Both morally
                        and spiritually they were pictures of perfection and stood out alone in the multitude of
                        intelligentsia, never deviating from the teachings of the Quran or the tradition of the Prophet.
                        Their one paramount aim of life was the selfless service of mankind, strictly in accordance with
                        the teachings of the holy Quran both, in letter and spirit these holy teachers of Islam in the
                        garb of Sufi dervishes continued to keep the banner of Islam flying for a period of nearly 900
                        years after the death of the holy Prophet Mohammed by their matchless zeal, abstemious character
                        and amazing spiritual powers and it is due to this unique dedication to the service of mankind
                        that there are today 90 crores of Muslims spreading all over the world whose ‘faith’ in their
                        religion remains as staunch and unshakable as it has ever been in spite of all the political and
                        social revolutions of the world ever since the death of Prophet Mohammed.

                        changed both the map and the course of Indian history at a crucial period of her destiny not by
                        sword or cannon but by the sweet and melodious spell of his spiritual sway plus unparalleled
                        moral and religious character, a revolution which ushered in quite a new era of peace and
                        prosperity for millions of Indians, and a revolution which the march of history and the present
                        civilization cannot afford to forget in the interests of mutual love and peace for which the
                        people of the world are so intensely thirsting today.

                        Because mutual goodwill and confidence between man and man and nation and nation are once more
                        rapidly deteriorating, and because the world is searching for a lasting peace against the forces
                        of Satan that have once again raised their monstrous head under the intoxication of new kind of
                        scientific materialism, the teachings of Hazarat Khwaja Munniuddin and Islam must, therefore, be
                        revived in the interests of world peace, as much as other recognised religions.

                        We are sure, these lessons will prove of immense value in easing the political and religious
                        tensions and restoring the waning faith of man in God and Religion without which there can be no
                        lasting peace in the world.

                        Subject Of Islam

                        One of the strangest facts in today’s world is that Islam, a religion which in many ways is
                        almost identical to Christianity and Judaism, should be so poorly understood in Europe and
                        America. Since there are millions of Moslems in the world, and since they control many strategic
                        areas of the earth it is essential that we understand them better.

                        Mohammed, the inspired man who founded Islam, was born about 570 AD at Mecca. Orphaned at birth,
                        he was always particularly solicitous of the poor, needy, widows, orphan, slaves and the
                        downtrodden. At 20 he was already a successful businessman and soon he became the director of
                        camel caravans of a wealthy widow. When he reached 25, his employer recognising his merit
                        proposed marriage. Even though she was 15 years senior, he married her and as long as she lived,
                        he remained a devoted husband.

                        By 40 this man of the desert had secured for himself a most satisfying life, a loving wife, fine
                        children and wealth. Then, Moslems believe, in a series of dramatic and terrifying events, he
                        began to revive through Archangel Gabriel a revelation of God’s word.

                        Like almost every major Prophet before him, Mohammed fought shy of serving as the transmitter of
                        God’s word, sensing his own inadequacy. But the angel commanded, ‘Read’. So far as we know,
                        Mohammed was hardly able to read or write, but he began to dictate those inspired words which
                        would soon revolutionize a large part of the earth; “There is but one God”.

                        Mohammed’s message infuriated those rich Arabs whose faith required many idols, and he and his
                        few followers were driven from Mecca, his home. Forced now to fight in defense of the freedom of
                        conscience which he preached, he became an accomplished military leader. He repeatedly went into
                        battle, out-manned and out-speared as much as five to one, he won some spectacular victories.

                        Later he became head of the state, and the testimony even of his enemies is that he administered
                        wisely. The wisdom he displayed in judging intricate cases became the basis for the religious
                        law that governs Islam today. In his final years, he was invited to become a dictator or a
                        saint, but he rejected both temptations, insisting that he was an average man to whom God had
                        sent another of his periodic messages to the world.

                        By the force of his extraordinary personality, Mohammed revolutionized life in Arabia and
                        throughout the Middle East. He preached a religion dedicated to one God and he lifted women from
                        the bondage in which desert custom held them and preached general social justice.

                        Moslems think it particularly ironic when Mohammed is charged by Western writers with having
                        established a voluptuous religion. Especially considering the fact that he abolished alcohol so
                        that even today all good Moslems are teetotalers. He ordered individual prayers five times each
                        day. In a nation that reveled in feasting he instituted a most rigorous daytime fast lasting a
                        full month each year.

                        Western critics have based their charges of voluptuousness mainly on the question of women.
                        Before Mohammed, however men were encouraged to take innumerable wives, he limited them to four
                        only and the Qoran is explicit that husbands who cannot maintain strict equality between two or
                        more wives must confine themselves to one.

                        A widespread misunderstanding arises from Mohammed’s promise of paradise. In a land of
                        blistering drought and sandstorms he predicted that evil men would suffer the tormenting fires
                        of hell. Whereas good men will experience cool breezes, comforting streams and beautiful hours.

                        Western imaginations, unfamiliar with this last word hour, defined it by analogy with one of the
                        ugliest words in English and jumped to the conclusion that Mohammed’s paradise was to be a
                        sexual debauch. They were wrong. A hour is a fair-skinned, blacked woman created from musk and
                        spices, incredibly beautiful and perpetually virgin.

                        In all things, Mohammed was profoundly practical. When his beloved son Ibrahim died, an eclipse
                        occurred, and rumours of God’s personal condolence quickly arose. Whereupon Mohammed is said to
                        have announced-” An eclipse is a phenomenon of nature. It is foolish to attribute such things to
                        the birth or death of a human being.”

                        At Mohammed’s own death an attempt was made to deify him, but the man who was to become his
                        administrative successor killed the hysteria with one of the noblest speeches in religious
                        history. “If there are any among you who worshipped Mohammed, he is dead. But if it was God you
                        worshipped, he lives for ever.”

                        These things explain why people who follow the religion of Mohammed do not like to be called
                        Mohammedan

                        Islam And Sufism > Subject Of Islam > The Book

                        The Quran is probably the most often read book in the world, surely the most often memorized,
                        and possibly the most influential in the daily life of the people who believe in it. Unlike the
                        New Testament, which is written in an exalted style, it is neither poetry nor ordinary prose,
                        yet it possesses the ability to arouse its hearers to ecstasies of faith. Its rhythms have been
                        compared to the beat of drums to the echoes of nature and to the chants which are common in all
                        early societies.

                        It is written in Arabic, and devout Moslems have often insisted that it must not be translated
                        into any other language. One might expect that such a wish would have limited the spread of
                        Islam. On the contrary, all over the world men have laboured to learn Arabic, not an easy
                        language just to be able to read their holy book and pray in the original.

                        The Qoran was revealed to Mohammed between the years 610 and 632 AD in the cities of Mecca and
                        Medina. Devoted scribes wrote it down on “scraps of paper, bark and the white shoulder blades of
                        animals. The early revelations were dazzling assurances that there was only one God, Merciful
                        and Compassionate; He is Allah, the Creator, the Maker, and the Fashioner. Whatever is in the
                        heavens and the earth declares His glory and He is the Mighty, the Wise.

                        It was this message that inspired men to revolutionize their lives and their nations. In later
                        years, when Islam began to penetrate large areas of Arabia and had acquired much power, the
                        revelations dealt with the organisation of society its laws, procedures and problems.

                        The Christian or Jew who reads the Qoran finds himself on familiar ground a good deal of the
                        time. Many revered names from Christianity and Judaism appear in the Qoran. For example, five of
                        the important chapters are entitled Noah Jonah, Joseph, Abraham, and Mary. Lacking specific
                        chapters of there own, but playing quite important roles are Jesus, Adam, David, Goliath, Job,
                        Moses, Lot and Solomon.

                        Islam is partly founded on the words of four Prophets who lived before Mohammed; Jesus, Noah,
                        Abraham, Moses. The Qoran does not acknowledge that Jesus was the Son of God and that He
                        suffered death upon the Cross. If Jesus were acknowledged the child of God, Moslems believe it
                        would compromise God’s oneness, the belief which is the cornerstone of Islam. It would, moreover
                        be difficult thereafter to contend that Mohammed was the bearer of the final perfect revelation
                        as Moslems do.

                        It is this dedication to one God plus practical instruction that makes the Qoran unique. Each
                        Islamic nation contains many citizens who are convinced that their land will be groaned well
                        only if its laws conform to Quran

                        Islam And Sufism > Subject Of Islam > Traditions

                        In addition to the Quran Islam relies upon ‘traditions’, what Mohammed said and did. These are
                        largely affectionate campfire gossip, the odds and ends that would be remembered after a great
                        man had died.

                        About 200 years after Mohammed’s death, more than 6,00,000 separator anecdotes about him were
                        still current, and several great scholars undertook the job of checking them for historical
                        validity. More than 5,97,000 were rejected. The remainders called the Hadith, are accepted by
                        all good Moslems.

                        Much of Islam’s common sense comes from them. For example, one dark night Mohammed had to escort
                        his wife home from the mosque. On the way he saw two men giggling in the shadows so he called
                        them to him, lifted his wife’s veil and said, “See, it is my wife with whom I walk.” When the
                        strangers protested that they trusted him, he said; “I was not worried about your trust of me. I
                        did not want your faith to be affected by your suspicions.

                        Once a Jew came to the Prophet and protested that Mohammed’s chief assistant had outraged Jews
                        by claiming that Mohammed was more exalted than Moses. The Prophet said to his assistant: “You
                        should not have said this. The feelings of other people must be respected.”

                        Also some of the profoundest elements of Moslem faith and culture derive from these traditions.
                        Every Moslem, before beginning a meal or entering upon any other task, repeats ‘In the name of
                        God, Most Merciful, Most Beneficent’. This is the opening verse of the Qoran. Moslems greet each
                        other with the traditional salutation “peace be on you.” The whole ritual of congregational
                        prayer is taken from the traditions, including the well-known call to worship.

                        Some traditions influenced Western behaviour. On one occasion, Mohammed saw a donkey being
                        branded on the face. When asked why this was being done, the herdsmen said, “The Romans taught
                        us this to prevent theft”. Mohammed reflected a moment and said: “An animal’s face is the most
                        sensitive part of its body. If you must brand, then do it on the flanks, where the flesh is
                        thicker”. And the custom spread.

                        As a successful general, Mohammed left many traditions regarding decent conduct in war.
                        “Faithfully carry out all covenants and agreements. Avoid treachery and do not disfigure the
                        enemy dead. Do not slay children, women, old men or persons dedicated to the service of
                        religion. Do not destroy sacred objects, orchards or crops.

                        Throughout the traditions Mohammed appears as a saintly man, one whom devout people of all
                        religions would have recognised immediately as deeply concerned about the nature of God. He
                        preached that slaves should be set free, that fathers should not kill unwanted baby girls, that
                        those oppressed by society inherit the earth, that peace is much proof that Mohammed hoped for
                        the day when all who shared a common belief in God would exist together in peace. It is well
                        documented that, on one occasion, when a deputation of Christians visited him, he said, when
                        time for prayers arrived, “Conduct your service here in the mosque. It is a place consecrated of
                        God.

                        No other religion in history spread so rapidly as Islam. By the time of Mohammed’s death (AD
                        632) Islam controlled a great part of Arabia. Soon it triumphed in Syria, Persia, Egypt, and the
                        lower borders of present Russia and across North Africa to the gates of Spain. In the next
                        century its progress was even more spectacular.

                        The West has widely believed that this surge of religion was made possible by the sword. But no
                        modern scholar accepts that idea, and the Quran is explicit in support of freedom of conscience.
                        The evidence is strong that Islam welcomed the people of many diverse religions, so long as they
                        behaved themselves and paid extra taxes. Mohammed constantly taught that Moslems should
                        cooperate with the “people of the Book” (Jews and Christians).

                        Islam And Sufism > Subject Of Islam > Important Facts

                        Many Westerners, accustomed by their history books to believe that Moslems were barbarous
                        infidels, find it difficult to comprehend how profoundly our intellectual life has been
                        influenced by Moslem scholars in the fields of science, medicine, mathematics, geography and
                        philosophy. Crusaders who invade the Holy Land to fight Moslems returned to Europe with new
                        ideas of love, poetry chivalry, warfare and government. Our concept of what a university should
                        be was deeply modified by Moslem scholars who perfected the writing of history and who brought
                        to Europe much Greek learning.

                        More than most religions, Islam preaches the brotherhood of all races, colours and nations
                        within its fold. Mohammed himself probably had the same skin colouring as Jesus, a very
                        suntanned white but today his followers embrace all colours: black men from Africa, yellow men
                        from China, brown men from Malaya, white men from Turkey.

                        For long periods in history Moslem nations strayed far from the spirit of Mohammed. If one focus
                        only upon the worst Persian and Turkish caliphs one can easily condemn Islam as a religion that
                        failed. But one can find such similar dark spots in the history of Christianity. If one looks at
                        the enormous good that Islam has achieved, however, one sees the permanent greatness of this
                        religion.

                        Propagation Islam

                        “The Brotherhood of Truth is one in all ages, it is narrow men who create sects. Let them not
                        think that the goods of this world can shield them from evil or its consequences. God’s Truth
                        and His messenger can be known to all: for He in His mercy has given us faculties and judgement
                        if we would but use them. The message is not new: all Creation proclaims it, High above all is
                        the Lord of Glory Supreme.” (Holy Quran: XXIII C. 155)

                        Islam And Sufism > Propagation Of Islam > Clarification

                        Besides the various old scholars and impartial historians belonging to other religions, many of
                        the recent writers on Islam, like Khawaja Kamaluddin (author of “The Ideal Prophet”);, Syed Amir
                        Ali (author of “The Spirit of Islam”) and Al-Haj Dr. M. A. Salmin (author of ‘The Holy prophet
                        Through Different Lights) have also refuted this fallacious charge. We are reproducing here a
                        few relevant ‘extracts’ from their works:

                        Writing about Prophet Mohammed’s migration from Mecca to Medina, Dr. M. A. Salmin says: ” The
                        Prophet next turned his attention to another important affair, namely to establish friendly
                        relations between the various tribes inhabitance in and around Medina. He was not satisfied with
                        the brotherhood that he had established between Muslims in Medina and the resident-emigrant
                        Muslims there. He concluded a pact between Aus and Khazraj, (who had now embraced Islam) and the
                        Jews. The terms were:

                        (1) The Muslims and the Jews shall live as one people.

                        (2) Each one of the parties shall keep its own faith; neither shall interfere with that of the
                        other.

                        (3) In the event of war with a third party, each was bound to come to the assistance of the
                        other provided the latter were the party aggrieved and not the aggressors.

                        (4) In the event of an attack on Medina, both shall join hands to defend it.

                        (5) Peace, when desirable, shall be made in consultation with each other.

                        (6) Medina shall be regarded as sacred by both all bloodshed being forbidden there.

                        (7) The Prophet shall be the final court of appeal in case of dispute.”

                        These terms which from the starting point of Islam, themselves refute the baseless charge of
                        spreading it by the force of sword. On the contrary, they prove “how the prophet was anxious to
                        maintain an atmosphere of peace and harmony among all classes of people in Medina from the very
                        beginning of his hijrat (migration) there.” Bloodshed was and is entirely against the spirit of
                        Islam and repugnant to the teachings of the Prophet. The warfare which the Muslims were forced
                        to resort to was purely defensive. It was certainly not to propagate their faith. It was only to
                        defend themselves against their archenemies that always took initiative to attack with a view to
                        destroy Islam and its Prophet. The instinct of self-preservation is as natural to man as
                        breathing to his life; therefore to fight in self-defense does not mean that Islam wielded sword
                        for the propagation of its faith. “All religions, all governments, all people have the right to
                        fight for their protection.” On the other hand, in the latter history of Christianity we see
                        that sword was used indiscriminately for the slaughter of all non-Christians. Even among the
                        Christians themselves, those who did not follow the Church of Rome were slaughtered mercilessly.
                        If any haughty Muslim ruler or exploiter acted contrary to the teachings of Islam, it was his
                        personal fault which cannot be laid at the door of Islam and for which he will be answerable to
                        God according to Islamic restrictions. Against the militants, the Prophet declared: “He who is
                        not affectionate to God’s creatures and to his own children would not receive the affection of
                        God.” (Abu Huraira). “Charity of the tongue, the most important and least cultivated of all
                        charities was likewise earnestly inculcated by Mohammed”, writes Irving. How can a religion that
                        keeps all the finer qualities of human character in the forefront be therefore, aggressive by
                        sword? The Prophet was supremely patient and tolerant when the bitter animosity, sedition and
                        betrayals of the Jews prevailed against Islam in Medina. It was in such a terrible state of
                        affairs that God ordered the Prophet: ‘Defend yourself against your enemies, but attack them not
                        first: God hates the aggressors” (Quran: 2: 190).

                        Citing various examples of coercion to which Muslims were subjected by the Jews and the
                        Christians, Dr. M. A. Salmin proceeds:

                        “I challenge anybody to show me an instance when the Prophet used sword, or force, or
                        compulsion, for the promulgation of his faith while, on the other hand, history tells of many
                        instances of dreadful wars waged by the Jews, the Christians and the gentle Parsis. In the case
                        of Jews, the force and compulsion were sanctioned by religion and in the case of early
                        Christians, the teachings of the Prophet of Nazareth were soon forgotten for the pride of power.
                        From the moment Christianity became a recognised force, it become aggressive and persecuting.
                        The name of religion served as the plea and justification of aggression upon the weaker nations
                        to lead to their spoliation and enslavement. Thus it is Islam that has suffered endless
                        persecution patiently at the hands of its enemies at every step of its peaceful propagation and
                        progress.”

                        Referring to the ‘diplomatic’ toleration of Christianity, Dr. Salmin continues: “In the history
                        of religion as well as individuals expect in Islam, we see that the spirit of toleration is
                        preached and insisted only as long as they have been powerless which spirit gave way to
                        intolerance and persecution the moment they attained power. Till the time of the conversion of
                        Constantine, Christianity was weak and in consequence remained passive, but from the moment of
                        the conversion of Constantine, it became safe for molestation. From this moment began a system
                        of religious persecution unparalleled in conception.” “From the very moment, writes Lecky, the
                        church obtained civil power under Constantine, the general principle of coercion was admitted
                        and acted upon against the Jews, the heretics and the pagans.”

                        Dr. Salmin multiplies such instances and then deplores yet the followers of this religion have
                        the temerity and impudence to say that Islam became militant since its advent in Medina. Yes,
                        Islam did become militant in so far as it was necessary to fight for self-preservation.”

                        It is a well-known fact that Islam as a religion never took initiative in aggression even
                        against its worst enemies. It was quite contrary to its spirit and teachings. Islam was always
                        ready to say to its enemies; “Cease hostilities, be our allies and we shall be faithful to you;
                        or pay tribute as a cost of protecting your life and property and we shall secure and protect
                        you in all your rights.” Muslim laws of war are also admittedly more human than those of any
                        other religion. The holy Quran has ordained: “And fight for the religion of God against those
                        who fight against you, but transgress not by attacking them first, for Allah loves not the
                        transgressors.”

                        The pulpit has always been subservient to statecraft. The clergy further the ends of the state
                        further than guard the conscience of the people. They read homilies of war when the state wants
                        war, as did the Bishop of London in 1914 at the Marble Arch, but they lay special stress on the
                        ‘Sermon on the Mount’ when the time has come for the sword to return to the scabbard. Humility,
                        meekness, forgiveness and nonresistance to evil are some of the claimed ethics of Christianity,
                        but her history discloses quite a different chapter. There we find heartless, sanguinary
                        persecution of others, want of charity and lack of kindness.”

                        While religious wars and persecution have blackened many chapters of European history, it must
                        be noted that Prophet Mohammed always preached and practiced supreme toleration, allowing his
                        bitterest enemies full freedom of conscience in religious matters. We do not read of the
                        persecution of Galileos, Latimars and others in the annals of Islam. The prophet respected and
                        also preached to his followers to respect other religions. He also protected life and property
                        of the unbelievers without any discrimination whatever. Those Muslims who violate the laws of
                        Islam are not true Muslims

                        Sir Bernard Shaw, the learned philosopher and great novelist of England, predicted: ” I believe
                        the whole of the British Empire will adopt a reformed Mohammedanism before the end of its
                        wonderful vitality. It is the only religion which appears to possess that assimilating capacity
                        to the changing phases of existence which can make itself appeal to every age. The world must
                        doubtless attach high value to the predictions of great men like me have prophesied about the
                        faith of Mohammed that it would be acceptable tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to
                        the Europe of today. The medieval ecclesiastics either through ignorance or bigotry painted
                        Mohammedanism in the darkest colours. They were in fact trained to hate both the man Mohammed
                        and his religion. To them Mohammed was antichrist he must be called a saviour of humanity. I
                        believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would
                        succeed in solving the problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and
                        happiness. Europe is beginning to be enamoured of the creed of Mohammed. In the next century it
                        may go still further in recognising the utility of that creed in solving its problems, and it is
                        in this sense that you must understand my prediction.”

                        “Already even at the present time many of my own people and of Europe as well have gone over to
                        the faith of Mohammed. And the Islamisation of Europe may be said to have begun.”

                        Islam And Sufism > Propagation Of Islam > The Spirit Of Islam

                        To the Christians of Nazareth and the surrounding territories, the security of God and the
                        pledge of his prophet are extended for their lives, their religion and their property-the
                        present as well as the absent, and other besides; there shall be no interference with the
                        practice of their faith or their observances; nor any change in their rights or privileges; no
                        bishop shall be removed from his bishopric, nor any monk from his monastery, nor any priest from
                        his priesthood, and they shall continue to enjoy every thing great and small, as heretofore; no
                        image or cross shall be destroyed; they shall not oppress not be oppressed; they shall not
                        practice the rights of blood-vengeance as in the days of ignorance; no titles shall be levied
                        from them nor shall they be required to furnish provisions for the troops.

                        Can there be a nobler example of the religious toleration of Islam than this? It can certainly
                        not be the attitude of one who wanted to thrust onto others their religion at the point of
                        sword.

                        After the death of the Holy Prophet of Islam, who was the founder of true democracy in the
                        world, his four succeeding Caliphs also followed in their master’s sacred traditions most
                        scrupulously upholding the dignity of Islam both in letter and spirit by granting complete
                        freedom of conscience and protection of life and property to their non-Muslim brethren. In spite
                        of all the wealth of their expanding empire, these noble Caliphs-Abu Bakr, Omar, Usman and Ali,
                        lived the life of an ordinary humble citizen and ruled in true democratic spirit unseen and
                        unheard of in the history of the world. No ruler of the world has ever lived such an austere and
                        self-denying life. Indeed the history of Islam under these four Caliphs is the history of a new
                        era, a new civilisation and a new prosperity in the life of a medieval and savage mankind. Their
                        selfless rule was strictly dedicated to the noble cause of human welfare. But for their
                        exemplary character and sacrifices, there would have been no such galloping progress which Islam
                        was destined to make within 30 years of its birth.

                        Islam And Sufism > Propagation Of Islam > Gandhiji’s Tribute

                        Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest apostle of nonviolence and religious toleration of our time said
                        about the holy prophet and Islam:

                        “I become more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in the
                        scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the
                        scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his
                        intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and his own mission.”

                        “In its glorious days, Islam was not intolerant. It commanded the admiration of the world. When
                        the west was sunk in darkness a bright star rose in the eastern firmament and gave light and
                        comfort to a groaning world Islam is not a false religion. Let Hindus study it reverently, and
                        they will love it even as I do.”

                        Islam And Sufism > Propagation Of Islam >Sir Bernard Shaw’s Prediction

                        Sir Bernard Shaw, the learned philosopher and great novelist of England, predicted: ” I believe
                        the whole of the British Empire will adopt a reformed Mohammedanism before the end of its

                        doubtless attach high value to the predictions of great men like me I have prophesied about the
                        faith of Mohammed that it would be acceptable tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to
                        the Europe of today. The medieval ecclesiastics either through ignorance or bigotry painted
                        Mohammedanism in the darkest colours. They were in fact trained to hate both the man Mohammed

                        in this sense that you must understand my prediction.”

                        “Already even at the present time many of my own people and of Europe as well have gone over to

                        Islam And Sufism > Propagation Of Islam > Sir W Muir’s Tribute

                        The prophet of Islam was an ideal embodiment of such virtues as mercy, sympathy, magnanimity,
                        justice, forbearance and forgiveness. There is not a single instance to show that he ever used
                        force or preached violence to promulgate his religion or to revenge against his foes who
                        persistently dogged the early part of his prophetic mission. One of the many noblest examples of
                        his tolerance and forgiveness in history is seen in his peaceful but triumphant victory over
                        Mecca. It was not a military victory. It was the triumph of his magnificent moral and religious
                        character, unparalleled in the history of the world after many years of ceaseless oppression and
                        sanguinary wars waged by his enemies to destroy him and his religion. In this moment of great
                        triumph, the prophet remained god fearing, merciful and forgiving, magnanimously refusing to
                        avenge the Quraish tribe for their past misdeeds. He did not compel even a single soul to
                        embrace Islam under the pressure of his grand victory. Although the city of Mecca had
                        surrendered unconditionally and had recognised his authority, but all its inhabitants had not
                        till then embraced Islam nor had they formally acknowledged his prophetic claim. Verily the ways
                        of the Prophet were the ways of God. Here is a tribute which Sir William Muir pays to the
                        supreme and exemplary religious tolerance of the Holy Prophet: Thus he (the prophet) preached a
                        religious toleration that had never been known to the world before. If religious toleration must
                        be a necessary article of faith in the ‘Religion of Humanity’ it is surely another cogent
                        justification for Mohammed’s claim to the name of the Ideal Prophet.

                        Life of Sufi | Sufi Silsilas | Regulation and Practices | Training In Sufism | Stages Of
                        Mysticism

                        Life of Sufi

                        The life of a Sufi is the “life of the spirit ” regulated strictly in accordance with Islamic
                        theology and traditions. To attain this his first lesson is unshakable belief in the existence
                        of God and unconditional surrender to His will. This entails a strenuous life attended by rigid
                        austerity and self-denial. He has to undergo a course of training in regular prayers and
                        meditation to attain the Divine Knowledge and realisation of Truth. This particular knowledge is
                        passed on ‘in secret’ by one Sufi to another having the requisite qualifications i.e. one who
                        does not think evil does not see evil, does not hear evil and does not speak evil. Without this
                        Divine Knowledge, one cannot fathom the hidden mysteries of the Nature and those of the soul. To
                        sum up the whole object of Sufism is to attain the highest spiritual perfection.

                        A Sufi will be distinguishable from others on account of his detachment from his parents,
                        children, wealth, power, position and comforts. His ignorance vanishes in the effulgence of the
                        ‘Divine Light’ of the most High, the Lord of the entire Universe. In such an ecstatically
                        devotion there is neither pain nor sorrow for him as he is overwhelmingly dedicated to the will
                        of the Almighty God. Thus a Sufi saint is the Spiritual King, far above all temporal kings,
                        disguised in the patched robes of a humble dervish.

                        Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chisty (May peace of God be upon his soul) was one of the greatest Sufi
                        saints the world has ever known. His spiritual influence and benedictions have been, and are
                        still a perpetually source of inspiration courage and guidance to the afflicted humanity,
                        irrespective of caste creed or religion.

                        Sufi Silsilas

                        The Sufis are classified into four prominent silsilas (categories) or lines, viz. Qadaria,
                        Chishtia Suhraward and Naqshbandia.

                        Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty belonged to the second ‘silsila’. There is no fundamental
                        difference between these silsilas except in matters of minor details. They are all within the
                        framework of the Islamic law as laid down by the Holy Quran and expounded by Hadith but the
                        rituals applied for obtaining the communion or ‘raza’ of God are different just like the modern
                        Universities where student take different courses for obtaining a particular class of degree.
                        The Chishtia ‘silsila’ does not enjoin any indifferent belief from that of the other Hanafi
                        Sunni Mussalmans. Their belief is based upon the Holy Quran. A study of the lives of Chishty
                        saints, including Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin and his spiritual preceptor Hazrat Khwaja Usman
                        Harooni reveals that they preached and held purely Quranic beliefs. According to Shariat, every
                        Chishty saint has to follow the Quranic laws strictly.

                        The Sufi ‘silsilas’ however, are not sects. They grew up because people went to Sheikhs or
                        ‘murshids’ (religious masters) for spiritual guidance and training who invested those of their
                        disciples whom they regarded as spiritually fit to cater for the spiritual and moral needs of
                        others Traditions, no doubt, grew up differently in different ‘silsilas’. What is common between
                        the various Sufi ‘silsilas’ is confined to few spiritual practices like auraad (verses from
                        Quran) ‘sama’ (audition) certain festivals, institutions like veneration of the shrines, the
                        etiquette of visiting them and the devotion to certain leading personalities of the order. One
                        special features of the Chishtia order, which is particularly observable among the early Chishty
                        saints of India, is their love for all humanity. They sought to inculcate among their followers
                        an attitude of broad sympathy for the common man irrespective of caste, creed or nationality.
                        They stressed more on humanitarian of caste, creed or nationality. They stressed more on
                        humanitarian obligations of Muslims than on any other point. And that is why Khawaja Muinuddin
                        Chishty attracted lakhs of people to the vast circle of his devotees in India in a very short
                        time.

                        Regulation and Practices

                        There are certain regulations of Sufism which are called ‘Adraak’ and ‘Ehsas’ in Sufi parlance.
                        They are also known as ‘Arkaan Tasawwuf’ or ‘Arkaan-Baatani’ i.e. the rules and discipline for
                        the acquirement of the hidden wisdom or knowledge. They are divided into the “hidden wisdom” or
                        knowledge. They are divided into the following three categories:

                        (1) “Knowledge” i.e. the ‘divine Knowledge’ attainable through the rigid discipline of
                        ‘Shariat’.

                        (2) “Amal” i.e. action under the above discipline with unflinching faith and devotion.

                        (3) “Haal” i.e. the resulting reaction from ‘Amal’ or the action.

                        A Sufi aspirant’s first important step to act upon the above course is to seek a religious
                        preceptor or ‘murshid’ who should be a practical master of the said Divine Knowledge and its
                        training experience. His preliminary lessons start with,

                        (i) Liturgical practices and exercises with unswerving devotion to certain Quranic verses which
                        are pregnant with the Divine Knowledge in order to grasp their spiritual interpretation and
                        values.

                        (ii) A rigid control over his soul called ‘Nafs’which starts which renunciation and
                        self-mortification.

                        Training In Sufism

                        When a person decided to become a mystic or Sufi, he was expected to go to a Sheikh or Murshid
                        (master) and spend with him as much time as was deemed necessary by the Sheikh for his spiritual
                        development. During this period of apprenticeship which, in most cases, lasted a lifetime the
                        Sheikh used to instruct the disciple to perform mortification (Mujahedas) so as to gain control
                        over his appetitive soul, i.e. ‘Nafs’. This was done by performing service like hewing of wood,
                        drawing of water from the wells and so many other menial services in the Khanqah (the monastery
                        or chapel). Even Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty himself had to pass through this hard and
                        rigorous course of probation when he was under training for a period of 20 years with his
                        Pir-o-Murshid (master) Hazrat Khawaja Usman Harooni. Every Sufi saint had to perform these hard
                        services for his ‘Pir’ before achieving the robe of Khilafat (succession).

                        Stages Of Mysticism

                        According to the Islamic standard of judgment, the seeker after Truth, as stated above has to
                        pass through many stages before he can actually feel himself in commination with the Truth being
                        the ultimate object. The elementary condition is to have an unshakable faith and a firm resolve
                        in doing or not doing a thing that is termed ‘niyyat’ (intention) in Muslim theology which is
                        followed by repentance and penitence. The next stage is called “Mujaheda” (probation of
                        striving). When it reaches its zenith then the revelation process begins which is known as
                        “Mukashfa” (the uplifting of veil). At this stage the attainments of the saint (or Sufi) are so
                        exquisite that he emerges his identify in the will of God, the creator, and the reactions are
                        visible and affect the code and conduct of human beings. The effort by which each stage is
                        gained is called ‘haal’ (state). It is a state of joy or desire and when the seeker is in this
                        condition he falls into ‘wajd’ (ecstasy).

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism> Basis Of Sufism

                        Early history of Sufism reveals that this particular branch of Divine knowledge originated and
                        developed under conditions of strict discipline of quietism, seclusion, renunciation and
                        incessant devotion to prayers under the guidance of a ‘Murshid’ or spiritual preceptor. In the
                        popular sense, Sufism is known as mysticism in the West but it is not at par with the conception
                        which the word ‘Sufism’ actually carries in Islamic parlance. One of the advantages of this cult
                        is that its follower speedily discovers all the mysteries of Nature for the benefit of mankind.
                        Its greatest gospel is to Live and Let live’ and to bestow undiscriminating affection upon all
                        mankind. It caters for the real peace and spiritual needs of the people who are generally sick
                        of the material world and seek a spiritual asylum. To be brief, unless one is a God’s chosen man
                        endowed with the inherent natural spark of Divine love, pity and religious devotion, and is also
                        fit for the necessary hard Mujahedas (probation and strivings) one cannot become a prefect Sufi.

                        Brief History Of Sufism

                        The origin of the term Sufi is rather complex, but in general it signifies one who wears the
                        garment of ”suf” i.e. wool. In the beginning it was a mark of personal penitence though some
                        early Muslims, like Ibn Sirin (died 729 AD) criticised the ascetics for wearing Suf in imitation
                        of Jesus Christ. He said, “I prefer to follow the example of the Prophet who dressed in cotton.”
                        In the second century of Islam a particular group of ascetics of Kufa were generally called
                        al-Sufiya due to their dress. But, by 4th century wearing of woolen garments became the
                        recognised badge of the Sufis of Iraq and hence the term was commonly applied to all Muslim
                        mystics. In the same century, groups of these a sites used to assemble to recite aloud the holy
                        Quran and other religious pieces which practice gradually took on a liturgical character called
                        Zikr evolving into spiritual concerts named Sama (now popularly called Qawwali in India) with
                        their attendant perils of extreme ecstatic nervous.

                        Gradually a change was coming over the general character of Sufism. Its basis was ” fear of God
                        and His wrath to come ” with the mystical element of love and adoration. According to a woman
                        saint, Rabia al-Adawiya (died 891 AD) The mainspring of mysticism is Love. She said, “Love of
                        God had so absorbed me that neither love nor hate for any other things remains in my heart.”

                        Sufism In 12th Century

                        While Imam Ghazali (died 1111) and Abul Qasim Al Qashari (died 1072) laid the basic foundation
                        of Sufism, it was Ghos-ul-Azam, Mahboob Subhani Hazrat Sheikh Abdul Qadar Gilani (died 1166) who
                        helped to give it a real practical shape by instituting the famous “Qadaria” silsila of Sufis in
                        Baghdad in the 12th Christian century which did wonders in raising the cult at Sufism to a
                        glorious pitch in the succeeding generations. Sufism under Hazrat Gilani’s spiritual and moral
                        spell created a marvelous revolution which brought the whole of Afghanistan and its adjoining
                        parts in Islamic fold in a very short time. This was one of the greatest miracles of Sufism in
                        the history of Islam at a very crucial period. The number of converts after Hazrat Gilani’s
                        every preaching meeting, often exceeded 70,000 necessitating the employment of as many as 400
                        writers for the registration of these converts. Other Sufi saints of this century were Sheikh
                        Najeebuddin Abul Qahir Suhrawardy, Sheikh Akbar mohiuddin Ibn Arabi (1156-1240) and Hazrat
                        Sheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardy (1144-1234), the last named being the founder of another famous
                        “Suhrawardia” silsila which Sheikh Saadi embraced in his later years of life. Their services to
                        the cause of Islam proved exceedingly invaluable and their innumerable writings and speeches
                        helped to rejuvenate the waning spirit of Islam, serving the cause of Sufism itself as a guiding
                        star for all future generations.

                        Doctrine Of Sufism And Its Need

                        After the death of the Prophet the overpowering influence of his religion and sacred traditions
                        dominated the lives of his succeeding descendants and the Caliphs. During the early period of
                        Islam there was no necessity of any new cult like Sufism. But, as time passed on a revival of
                        the Islamic influence was deemed necessary and Sufism took it up in right earnest. The term
                        Sufism denotes nothing but a direct interpretation of the cardinal principles of Islam and
                        certain spiritual practices to be observed in this process. Its originator Abu Ishaq Shami was
                        the first Sufi who preached this cult which was in conformity with all the basic principles of
                        Islam.

                        Wealth Despised

                        One of the cardinal principles of the followers of Sufism is the hate of all wealth pomp and
                        show. All great Sufis have always therefore refused to accept any money or presents from any
                        quarters whatever, and they never went to the glittering courts of any monarch which made them
                        bold, selfless and independent of all secularism, thus distinguishing them from the class of the
                        Ulama, who so often succumbed to these temptations. On the contrary, if any ruler or rich person
                        sought an interview with them they either refused it flatly or gave them illuminating sermons,
                        bluntly reminding them of their misdeeds and instructing them to realise and follow their duties
                        and responsibilities to the cause of Islam and the Holy Prophet’s Shariat. Once Khalifa Abu
                        Muzaffar Yusuf of Baghdad approached Hazrat Gilani for a blissful advice with a present of 10
                        bags of gold mohurs. This great Sufi saint contemptuously refused to accept the money but when
                        the Khalifa insisted upon its acceptance he picked up two of the bags one in each hand, and
                        squeezed them. And as he did so human blood flowed out of them! The great saint said: “Abu
                        Muzaffar, don’t you feel shame in offering me this blood of the poor people?” The Khalifa was
                        dumbfounded and went away in a shameful disgust.

                        During the 13th century AD Sufism had gained greater popularity among the masses as the result
                        of the persistent efforts of the above named Sufi saint. Under the rule of the Ommayads and the
                        Abbassides, secularism had usurped the real spirit of Islam and had economic, political and
                        social fabric of Islam to pieces resulting in the ultimate downfall of their power itself.
                        Baghdad, once a flourishing capital, was in the grip of debasing frivolities and revelry.
                        Unbalanced secularism had caused unprecedented pillage, arson, murder and all round destruction
                        at the hands of Mongols and Tartars. Although this condition was generally attributed to the
                        intruders’ invasions but as a matter of fact it was primarily due to the deterioration of the
                        spiritual and moral character of the Muslims from top to bottom.

                        Attendance At Shrine

                        When these Sufi saints left this world their devotees put up impressive buildings over their
                        tombs (Mazaars) most of which are attractive monuments of architectural beauty and subdued
                        oriental splendour where Muslims, Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, and their beneficiaries pay loving
                        homage to their immortal glory all the year round, and receive all sorts of benedictions even to
                        this day. On the occasions of their death anniversaries, which are called Urs, the gatherings in
                        many cases run from thousands to lakhs, according to the popularity of the saint.

                        Religious ceremonies are performed on these occasions and the poor and the needy are fed
                        liberally. Of the numerous Sufi saints of India, Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chisty of Ajmer, (the
                        founder of Sufism in this country) Hazrat Makhdoom Allauddin Saabir of Kalyar and Hazrat Baba
                        Fariduddin Ganj Shakar of Pak Patan are the most celebrated. But each Indian province from North
                        to South and East to West has one or more monumental shrines of its own Sufi saints whose
                        benedictions have left an impressive mark upon the people of those parts and whose blessings
                        they still enjoy year after year.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism> Divine Love

                        The next important feature of Sufi belief was divine love. From the time of Rabia Al-Adawiya
                        (died 801 AD). It had become the mainstream of Sufism while in India it had become the dominant
                        feature of the popular Bhakti movement. Love they said was both the causes as well as the effect
                        of gnosis. A person was likely to achieve gnosis as a result of divine blessing only when he had
                        devotion for God. While a person who had achieved gnosis could not help being overwhelmed and
                        overpowered by cosmic emotion (jazba) and divine love. Love, according to them was emotive force
                        of life in fact raison d’être. This powerful emotion dominated every thought or sentiment,
                        contemplative life, theology, ritual thought of heaven and hell and all else. “The heart of a
                        mystics is a blazing furnace of love which burns and destroys everything that comes into it
                        because no fire is stronger than the fire of love”, says Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty. Love implied
                        an illuminative life a state of continued communion with Reality (haal). The object of life was
                        indifferently described as apologetic vision (sometimes used in spiritual sense at others in a
                        physical sense), nearness to God, annihilation (fana), everlasting life in God (baqa) and
                        ultimately absorption or union (wassail). It was only on the achieves tranquillity by falling
                        into the sea? Thus when the lover finds the beloved he no longer wails.”

                        The natural outcome of such an outlook was a religion of ecstatic fervour and intoxication
                        (Sukr). Such an attitude of mind could best be produced by and then find satisfaction in
                        liturgical practices (Azkaar-Zikr-e-khafi, zikr-e-jail), spiritual concerts or audition (sama),
                        and other forms of auto hypnosis. Because of the efforts of Khawaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki,
                        Sufi Hameeduddin Nagauri and Sheikh Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi, ‘sama’ became a cranial feature
                        of the Chishty silsila and brought it in occasional conflicts with the orthodox Ulama.

                        The mystic belief in gnosis and love is usually accompanied by characteristic ethics. The Sufis
                        had fully followed and systematised certain ethical concepts before Islam came to India. The
                        Indian Sufism merely reiterated these beliefs although there was difference in the degree of
                        emphasis. The basis of the Sufi attitude is that the Veil which hides Reality from mankind is
                        that of Bashariyat, (creature hood). The nature of man consists of sensual, intellectual and
                        spiritual features. Intellect, according to them performed a restricted function. The central
                        pivot of spiritual life was the Qalb (heart) or the Rooh (soul). They were regarded as ethereal
                        in nature and hence capable of communion with God. This function however could never be
                        performed until the heart was purified of the dirt of sensual or lower self called in Sufi
                        terminology the nafs (appetitive soul). The struggle against nafs regarded as wholly evil,
                        therefore, became one of the main concerns of the Sufis. This implied an outlook of
                        renunciation, penitence, asceticism, poverty, self-mortification and quietism-in short, other
                        worldliness. This other worldliness was never interpreted strictly and the Chishty product
                        recommended more an outlook of another-worldliness than actually going away from society.

                        The idea among the nobler minds in the world of Islam, that there is a deeper and more inward
                        sense in the words of the Quran arose not from the wish to escape from the rigour of ‘ texts and
                        dogmas’, but from a profound conviction that those words mean more, not less than the popular
                        expounders supposed them to convey. This conviction combined with a deep feeling of Divine
                        pervasion, a feeling originating from and in perfect accordance with the teachings of the Quran
                        and the instruction of the Prophet led to the development among the Muslims of that
                        contemplative idealistic philosophy which has received the name of Sufism. The appeal of which
                        among the Mohammedans was probably assisted by the prevalence of Neo-Platonic ideas.
                        Imam-al-Ghazzali in the East and Ibn Tufail in the West were the two great representatives of
                        mysticism among the Muslims.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism > Ulema Sufi Clash

                        Ulema – Sufi Clash

                        At first the leaders of mysticism were supposed to be the Ulema or orthodox religious teachers
                        but by the end of 3rd century they were replaced mostly by middle classes, specially from the
                        mixed half Persian and half Arabian population of Baghdad, who followed Sufism. Against the
                        political revolutionary aims of Shia’ite propagandists the Ulema protested vehemently. Their
                        programme of reform included the awakening of religious conscience of individuals and the
                        spiritual revival of the social organisation of the community. These social implications were
                        reinforced by the labours of Sufis in preaching and converting, firstly members of their own
                        class or followers and secondly carrying on their missionary work for Islam in other distant
                        lands. For all times and in all countries these Sufi ascetics were the most active and powerful
                        propagandists of Islam and it was none but Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty of Sanjar who
                        introduce the Chishtia silsila (order) of Sufis in India and did such a wonderful service to the
                        cause of Islam.

                        For the above reasons the orthodox Ulema began to suspect the new social implications of the
                        Sufi movement in Islam and a rift seemed to be widening between Sufism and orthodoxy. Serious
                        attempts were made to silence the Sufis and on failure an example of punishment was set of one
                        prominent Sufi Mansur al-Hallaj, who was charged with heresy in having identified himself with
                        God and was cruelty executed in the beginning of the 4th century. This punishment was not
                        inflicted by any violent fanatics but by pious upholders of the ancient Faith like the Good
                        Wazir’ Ale-ibn-Isa. Repression however proved futile and the Sufi movement continued firmly
                        based as it was on both the open and ‘secret’ teachings of Quran and the moral standards of
                        Islam. Despite the adverse views of the learned layers, the tendency towards the neglect of the
                        ritual prescriptions and the outside influence clashing with the traditional outlook of Islam
                        the strength of Sufism lay in the satisfaction which it gave to the religious instincts of the
                        people, instincts which were chilled or starved by the rigid and impersonal teachings of
                        orthodox Ulema but which found more relief in the directly personal and emotional approach of
                        Sufism.

                        It must be remembered that this popular character and appeal of Sufism arose out of the ranks of
                        the people themselves and appealed to the people whose main reading matter was furnished by
                        short lives of the saints often replete with their miraculous deeds. It was the unceasing
                        labours of the mystics ascetic or Sufis that gave to Islam its widespread permanent hold upon
                        the masses and that plated such a conspicuous part in spreading the Divine Message among new and
                        fertile lands rather than the slow work of purely orthodox Ulema or their system of propagation.

                        During the 4th and 5th centuries, Sufism grew in strength in spite of the frowning Ulema it was
                        in this period that the Zikr and Sama from their simple congregational recitation and meditation
                        over the Quran began to show more definite liturgical tendency marked specially by the
                        recitation of chants and litanies. But it was not this difference alone that marked off Sufism
                        from the orthodox services as similar liturgical ceremonies were commonly performed in the
                        mosques as well. The hostility of the theologians was however due partly to their fear that the
                        Sufi Zikr might replace the mosque as the center of religious life. There was also a more deeper
                        and selfish reason for the conflict, the traditional exclusive claim of the possession of
                        sciences of theology and law and their position as the sole authoritative exponents of the
                        Islamic doctrine-sciences which they had built up by infinite trouble and whose acquisition
                        involved long and arduous study. They maintained that it was by their means that the substances
                        of Faith had been preserved against both heretical innovations in doctrine and the attempts of
                        the secular arm to override its privileges and obligations.

                        Naturally the theologians were proud of their system and jealous for the maintenance of their
                        authority. They held that it was by this method alone that they were able to propagate Islam and
                        promote its cause and that any relaxation would open the way to heresy and corruption both
                        spiritual and material. But the Sufis rejected these claims bluntly and even derisively.
                        According to them there was only one way to knowledge which lay through the direct and personal
                        experience called “Marifat” culminating in momentary union with or absorption into the Godhead
                        and not through the rational and second hand knowledge or ilm of the scholastic type. They
                        thought, theology instead of assisting their process. Actually hindered it. The conflict between
                        the doctrinaire and the seeker or follower of the Inner Light therefore seemed irreconcilable.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism > Sufism Triumphed

                        The outside influences and doctrines implied in Sufism in these formative centuries, were also
                        suspected by the Ulema. Apart from the various orthodox rules and concepts of Islam the
                        exaltation which the holy Prophet Mohammed enjoyed also appeared to be eclipsing against the
                        overwhelming veneration accorded to Sufi sheikhs in their lifetime and their elevation to
                        sainthood after death. Nothing could, therefore be more intolerable and repugnant to the
                        primitive ideas of Islam and the system of their maintenance by the Ulema but in the teeth of
                        Quran. Tradition, rationalism and orthodox theology the worship of Sufi saints irresistibly
                        crept into the Islamic fold, and eventually swept everything before it. As time went on popular
                        elements of Sufism established themselves more and more firmly in the Islamic fold. More and
                        more religious minded people also joined the ranks of Sufi mystics who sought not metaphysical
                        knowledge of religion but living experience of God. During the 5th century there was a marked
                        drift towards Sufism of some of the ablest thinkers of Islam. Ultimately principle of compromise
                        between orthodoxy and Sufism was inevitably sought with the result that a celebrated theologian
                        Al-Qushari (died 1072 AD) wrote a treatise urging the cause of the higher Sufism and the
                        acceptance of the doctrine of ecstatic communion with God. The actual revolution is however
                        linked with the name of Imam al-Ghazale (died 1111 AD) who stands high in his religious insight
                        and intellectual ability and who dived deep into mystics sciences and philosophies. He changed
                        his convictions again and again in his long religious experiments and research. First, he
                        revolted against the casuistry of the theologians and incessantly sought ultimate reality
                        through all the Muslim religious systems and philosophies of his time.

                        After a prolonged bodily mental and intellectual struggle he finally fell from sheer philosophic
                        agnosticism upon his personal experience of God which he found only in the Sufi path. To his
                        school of thought belonged such Sufi giants as Maulana Rum the author of the celebrated Masnavi
                        (one of the most authentic works on Sufism) Hazrat Junaid Baghdadi, Maulana Shibli, Maulana
                        Fariduddin Attaar, Khaqani, Shamsuddin Haafiz Shirazi (one of the greatest Persian Sufi poets in
                        the East) Sheikh Sa’adi and others. Both Imam al-Ghazali and the stalwart Al-Qushari forged a
                        synthesis that ultimately accommodated the essential principles of Islam between orthodoxy and
                        Sufism which were thus tied to one and the other forever though their paths remained different.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism > Sufism In India

                        From Iraq and Persia, Sufism perpetrated into India with Hazarat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty where
                        it found a very congenial soil to prosper after some stubborn opposition. With its advent a
                        large number of Sufi saints sprang up all over the land, doing invaluable service by their
                        solacing influence to the afflicted humanity irrespective of caste or creed. It was this
                        indiscriminating service to the cause of the suffering humanity and peace that won the hearts of
                        the people of India and made the Sufis highly popular among all classes of people from a peasant
                        to the prince. Not only this but even after their death, they are still held in high reverence,
                        a thing which is unknown in other countries. This unflinching devotion is of course not with out
                        any reason; there must be “something” very real and serious to come and end it?

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism > Meritorious Contribution

                        Sufism in spite of its loftiness in religious ideals has been less fastidious and more ready to
                        accept alien practices and ideas provided they produced good results. Blended with Sufism the
                        orthodox couch was undoubtedly refreshed and strengthened and in fact acquired a more popular
                        character and attraction in Islam. Sufism in Western Asia, North Africa, won over large
                        multitudes to Islam. Central Asia, India and Indonesia. In the wake of Sufism, Shia’ism also
                        suffered an eclipse and lost much of its original influence. On the whole Sufism has made a
                        meritorious and invaluable contribution to the promotion and prosperity of Islam in the world.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism > Sufism Defined

                        Sufism implies “Iqtida” i.e. to adhere strictly to the laws of Shariat. It means highly pious
                        and enlightened way of life which may be expressed in conformity with thought and action as
                        explained below:

                        (a) `Qualan’ i.e. expression through ‘Shariat’ or the Divine Law (ordained for the harmonious
                        conduct of man in this world with promise of his salvation in the next.)

                        (b) `Failan’ or ‘Tariqat’ i.e. expression through human activity and discipline under the said
                        Divine Law or ‘Shariat.

                        (c) “Haalan” or Haqiqat i.e. the ‘state ‘ acquired by acting upon and passing through Qualan and
                        Failan stages reaching the zenith of the spiritual perfection.

                        While the Qualan and Failan stages can be analysed or expressed through the human faculties, the
                        expression of Haalan ‘Haqiqat’ or ‘Reality’ is beyond the scope of all human conception and is
                        therefore inexpressible and indescribable because human intellect or faculties are restricted to
                        a ‘limit and transcend no more. This is the highest and final stage of Sufism in which the
                        aspirant is face to face with the ‘Divine Light ‘ and ultimately merges his identity with God
                        Supreme. It is therefore a state, the secrets of which have never been divulged to the humanity
                        at large without Sufism entitles.A Persian couplet describes this ‘state’ as follows “Aan raa ke
                        Khabar shud Khabarash baaz nayamad.” i.e. nobody ever heard of them who dived deep into the
                        secrets of God or the mysteries of Nature.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism > Ma’Arifat

                        The Sufis emphasised that ultimate Reality could be grasped only intuitively (Ma’arifat or
                        gnosis). It was veiled from the human eye and intellect, and constituted a mystery which could
                        be apprehended by none but the advanced spirits. Although they described in vivid details how
                        Ma’arifat could be achieved they never concerned themselves with the nature of the Reality.
                        There are clear traces of belief of pantheism and of monism, although in general they believed
                        in a transcendental omnipotent God as the Creator of the universe.

                        The intuitive or esoteric experience or Reality implied that parallel to the orthodoxy or
                        “external” theology, there was also an “internal” or spiritual interpretation of the Holy Quran
                        and of the actions prescribed by the Law. This spiritual interpretation was necessity
                        subjective, intuitive and esoteric. But this is a very delicate point to be discussed by a
                        layman. Only the advanced Sufis or Saints, who are now rare, can interpret them satisfactorily
                        in the light of their own practical experience. No one in the present scientific civilisation
                        can either understand or convince easily the average man on these delicate points.

                        Islam And Sufism > Philosophy Of Sufism>The Process

                        According to Islamic conception a Sufi is one who is fired with Divine live and who as a true
                        devotee of God and is constantly impatient to seek nearness to HIM. The quest of a Sufi centers
                        round the exploration or probe into the mysteries of the nature. He is whole-heartedly engrossed
                        in seeking out the myriad truths of the TRUTH, and concentrates on the hard task of reconciling
                        his action to his thoughts. This is an extremely difficult process. He has, first of all to
                        suppress or subdue his worldly desires inherent in the soul of man called Nafs in order to
                        attain purity and steadfastness in his character. After attaining this stage, he enters the
                        second phase of building up his external and internal character through mental exercises as the
                        result of which the knowledge of the hidden mysteries of Nature or God is revealed unto him. To
                        summarise the whole process of Sufism, the true path of a Sufi’s salvation lies through the
                        thorny wilderness of renunciation, self-mortification on and annihilation of the Nafs by
                        incessant devotion to God. Thus a Sufi aspirant has to under go a rigid test in morals and by
                        acquiring a perfect knowledge of the Quran and Islamic theology. Also strict adherence to the
                        Muslim law of jurisprudence called ‘Fiqah’ and ‘Hadith’ which deal with the moral, social,
                        economic, and political aspects of Muslim life, he reaches his goal ultimately.

                        Shariat And Tariqat

                        The basis of the teachings of the early Sufis was a clear distinction between the real and the
                        apparent, between the external and the internal, between the formal and the spiritual. The codes
                        of beliefs and behaviour prescribed in the two were the Shariat which they called ‘external
                        science’ and the Tariqat (the path or way) or the ‘internal’ or “spiritual science”. The
                        starting point of the spiritual progress, they argued was the Shariat but their distinctive
                        contribution to the religious life of the Muslims was the emphasis which they laid on Tariqat.
                        They bypassed the abstract and colourless scholastic discussions of faith and ritual, and
                        supplemented the inspiring orthodox attitude of commands and prohibitions with an “emotive
                        principal and a living religious experience.” In orthodox Islam, these features had become
                        subordinated. By emphasising them the Sufis sought to restore the religious balance and brought
                        Islam into greater harmony with the prevailing Indian traditions.

                        Islam And Sufism > Cardinal Principles Of Islam

                        Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin mission was dedicated to the sacred cause of peace and salvation of
                        mankind from the moment he set his holy feet on the soil of India in 1191 AD. His life work is
                        therefore of very absorbing interest to the suffering humanity particularly at a time when the
                        world is once more torn by mutual hatred and survives precariously at the mercy of Atom and
                        Hydrogen bombs. Indeed the teachings of this great saint have been a perpetual source of solace
                        and inspiration to the past 750 years. His grand success was based upon the magnificent lessons
                        of Islam coupled with the inspirations he used to get from the divine powers which in the
                        terminology of Sufism, are the basic teachings of the Holy Quran as elaborated in Hadith and
                        Fiqah having their root in the religion of Islam.

                        Islam And Sufism > Cardinal Principles Of Islam > What Is Islam

                        A comparative study of Islam will reveal that it is the most practical and latest religion in
                        the world that suits all human requirements. It completes the final “Divine Message of God” for
                        the good conduct of man on earth – a message which He delivered in parts, through His various
                        other Prophets before Prophet Mohammed, as revealed and confirmed in the Holy Quran.

                        Islam’s most distinguishing features, as a world religion:

                        Its simplicity

                        Its explicitness

                        Its highly realistic attitude towards the day-to-day life of man.

                        It enjoins upon its followers to observe moderation in all things relating to man’s conduct and
                        behaviour. Islam does not tolerate revelry and yet it does not shun all joy, best and adventure.
                        It adopts a middle course between the extremities and discards Puritanism and moral anarchy but
                        it allows freedom and satisfaction to all natural human desires and instincts, including even
                        the instinct of war PROVIDED certain limitations are strictly observed.

                        Islam recognises that social conditions have a great influence in shaping human character and
                        therefore it tries to set right the social, political and economic systems of mankind in
                        accordance with its moral and spiritual values. Islam does not recognise that mere improvements
                        in social, political and economic conditions as preached by Communism and other Western type of
                        ‘ism’ will make people virtuous and prosperous in their conduct of life. It advocates and
                        insists upon individual reform and self-discipline through unswerving belief in God, His line of
                        Prophets, their respective scriptures the angles His last Prophet Mohammed and the resurrection
                        after death on the Day-of-Judgment.

                        Islam lays final responsibility on the individual for all his actions. In Islam you cannot plead
                        that because you were born in an evil environment, therefore you could not shake off its evil
                        influence to lead a pious virtuous and ordered life, and that society was responsible for your
                        sins of omission and commission. There is no appeal against Islamic law which is the law of God,
                        and one must necessarily discipline himself according to it if one desire well-being in life and
                        salvation after death.

                        Islam does not want people to be tolerant to evil and injustice for fear of incurring the
                        displeasure or wrath of those who happen to be in strength and power. Those who tolerate this
                        are in the eyes of Islam no better those evildoers.

                        For the selfish and greedy there is no place of honour in Islam. The moral and religious
                        attitude of Islam must follow its adherents in all walks of life. A Muslim cannot be a Muslim in
                        the mosque and a socialist nationalist or communist on a political platform outside. At every
                        step of his life he is a Muslim always guided by the Laws of Allah – embodied in the Holy Quran
                        and expounded by the Holy Prophet Mohammed.

                        Among all the religions of the world, Islam stands alone, teaching humanity that political power
                        must be subordinated to ethical values that religion should not be allowed to serve the ends of
                        a state which is not informed and actuated by moral values, ideals and decencies.

                        Islam is the only religion that made international brotherhood a reality. It recognises no
                        racial and political barriers. It stands alone for its complete freedom from the domination of
                        priestly class and the burden of cumbersome ceremonials and rituals

                        Islam And Sufism > Cardinal Principles Of Islam >Conception Of God

                        The whole structure of Islam is based upon the conception that all other tenets principles and
                        injunctions of Islam flow. Once this paramount conception is admitted, then many important and
                        relevant questions as to the relationship of man with God arise. For instance what is the law of
                        God’s pleasure for the conduct of man, a rational animal on earth? How He desires to shape man’s
                        conduct and destiny in his life? Without a clear answer to these questions it is meaningless to
                        merely affirm God’s existence. The east does not believe in God like the West whose conception
                        is that “God is nothing more than a mere creator” and having created the universe, He has
                        retired to the seventh heaven and left man to do as he pleases. If such a conception were
                        admitted, then it would be very difficult to distinguish between good and evil justice and
                        injustice because if moral standards and ethical values have no relation with God who created us
                        then they are no more than mere ideas based on expediency and shaped only by our social
                        necessities. We hear the name of God repeated by Western statesmen and warlords in times of
                        distress and wars. According to their conception, God seems to serve equally the national and
                        imperial interests of both the belligerent sides. Such a role can never be the role of God. His
                        position has been reversed. How can man be the master whose causes God is called upon to serve?
                        This belief amounts to open disbelief in God. If we truly believe in God then we must take Him
                        not merely as the Creator of the world but also as its “guide and sustainer” And it is we
                        therefore who must serve the cause of God for we are his servants and He is our Master. It is we
                        who ought to seek His will and shape our conduct and destiny in life in accordance with His will
                        explained through the code of religion which has been propounded by his holy messengers and
                        Prophets from time to time ever since the creation of the world. All our loyalty to other
                        worldly causes is misplaced and misdirected. We have to associate ourselves finally and
                        irrevocably with His will and pleasure and not with our own or any other’s..

                        Islam And Sufism > Cardinal Principles Of Islam > Sovereignty Belongs To God

                        But how can we know God’s cause and discover His will with our ‘limited’ intelligence except
                        through His own ‘Self-revelation’? Not all the wisdom of the world can give us any knowledge of
                        the Almighty God’s attributes and of how He wills us to shape our lives? According to Islam. God
                        has revealed His will through his many chosen prophets from time to time ever since He created
                        the world, and has given the people express commands to do some things and abstain from others.
                        Through his revelations in the holy Quran, He has shown us how our individual and collective
                        lives should be shaped to win His pleasure and acquire our own peace and salvation. He has not
                        left our guidance to the whims of any worldly leaders or the so-called “sovereign people” to be
                        determined by the counting of heads because in Islam, sovereignty belongs to the Almighty God
                        and God alone. No people can usurp his sovereignty and if they do, they are rebels against God.
                        Therefore the life of man in Islam is an act of devoted worship of God and complete surrender to
                        His will. The simple rituals of offering prayers, etc. are merely outward worship and if they
                        are not supplemented by a concentrated effort at living in accordance with the Divine will and
                        commands the life of man becomes a meaningless and fruitless affair. Hence Islam’s social and
                        political aspects are not excluded from the sovereign authority of God, as the Western
                        civilisation would like our modern society and its conduct to be.

                        To those who would worship ‘anything’ possessing the attributes of power and force, Islam says ”
                        Do not bow down before the rivers, the mountains, the sun and the moon, for none of these and
                        other forces of nature has the least power to do you injury or benefit you without the will of
                        God. All obedience is subject to the final and absolute loyalty to God and His commands as
                        revealed in the Holy Quran through the holy prophet of Islam. Obedience to other authorities can
                        be rendered only in so far as their commands do not go against or contradict the Divine
                        commands. The doctrine of the oneness of God has therefore the greatest significance in Islam. A
                        Muslim cannot by mere vote of the majority change even an iota of the legal and moral precepts
                        of the Holy Quran or the “Law of God ” which says-obey God, obey the prophet and obey those who
                        are in authority from amongst yourselves, but if there is difference of opinion either amongst
                        yourselves or with those who are in authority over you, turn to God and the prophet for
                        decision. Thus God and the prophet are the final arbiters in all matters of dispute whether
                        social, political or economic. This, in a nutshell, was the “Message of Islam” and peace which
                        Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishti was deputed, by a Divine decree to preach to the people of
                        Hindustan 750 year ago. His life and work are an outstanding inspiration and an amazing miracle
                        for those who have a keen eye to see through them objectively and dispassionately.

                        Islam And Sufism > Western Scholars On Quran

                        “That part of Islam which most distinctly reveals the mind of its author is also its most
                        complete and its most admirable part, we mean the ethics of the Quran. They are not found any
                        more than the other laws brought together in one or two ‘Suras’ but “like golden threads” they
                        are woven into the huge fabric of the religious constitution of Mohammed. Injustice, falsehood,
                        pride, revengefulness, calumny, mockery, avarice, prodigality, debauchery, mistrust, and
                        suspicion are inveighed against as ungodly and wicked; while benevolence liberality, modesty,
                        forbearance, patience and endurance frugality, sincerity, straightforwardness, decency love of
                        peace and truth and above all trust in God and submission to His will are considered as the
                        pillars of true piety and the principal signs of a true believer. Nor must we omit to point out
                        expressly that Mohammed never laid down that doctrine of absolute predestination which destroys
                        all human will and freedom, because the individual’s deeds cannot alter one iota in his destiny
                        either in this world or in the next. So far from it foolhardiness is distinctly prohibited in
                        the Quran. Caution is recommended. And a glance at the whole system of faith which is built on
                        hope and fear rewards and punishment paradise and hell destined to be man’s portion.”
