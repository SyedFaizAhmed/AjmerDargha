                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life

                            When Hazrat Khwaja Muinuddin was born (536 AH) at Chisht in Sistan, which is also known as
                            Sajistan, East Persia. The peace of the Muslim world was horribly disturbed. Sistan and its
                            surrounding lands were experiencing unprecedented bloodshed and plunder at the hands of
                            barbarous Tartars and other rebels. These intruders had taken advantage of the weak
                            government of Sultan Sanjar. The life and honour of the people were in constant danger. The
                            wild Tartars had completely destroyed the follower of the Muslim nation. They outraged
                            humanity practically in all the centers of the 600-year old Muslim civilisation and culture.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life >Migration To Neshapur

                            Due to these intermittent political disturbances in sistan, khawaja Ghiyasuddin Hasan,
                            father of khawaja Muinuddin, one day decided to pack up and leave Sistan for a safer place.
                            He migrated with his family to Neshapur the Capital city, which was one of the most
                            flourishing cities in those days. It was a great centre of intellectual and economic
                            activities and possessed the famous “Nizamia” university with a precious library that
                            contained rare collection of Original literature. There lived learned Ulama and reputed
                            Sufis who imparted knowledge in moral and spiritual enlightenment to scholars drawn from far
                            and near. There lived physicians and artists of rare qualifications. There were rich gardens
                            and canals with flourishing agricultural fields. One of the suburbs was called Rewand which
                            was famous for its grape orchards. It is recorded that khawaja Ghiyasuddin Hasan bought an
                            orchard with a windmill in this vicinity to settle down for a peaceful life.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life > No Peace Of Mind

                            “Man proposes but God disposes” is an old saying. The peace in search of which Khawaja
                            Ghiyasuddin Hasan had migrated to Neshapur was not to be had even in this great city. Here
                            too the people were hanging in a terrible suspense between life and death. The brave Sultan
                            Sanjar had been fighting the Tartars at the border to check them for a long time without
                            success. Due to his prolonged absence from the capital, his administrative machinery was
                            showing signs of disintegration. Internally, the Fidayees of the ‘Qarmti’ and ‘Baatini’
                            sects (one of whose members had already murdered the able Wazeer Nizamul Mulk) had also come
                            out of their hideouts and were roaming about the country unabated, spreading wild fire of
                            rebellion all round. These armed hordes were busy in wholesale plunder and massacre of the
                            innocent people.

                            These awe-inspiring events had a very deep impression on the mind of the young Khawaja
                            Muinuddin who was watching the whole barbarous drama objectively at his impressionable young
                            age.

                            The ‘Qarmti’ and Baatani’ intriguers had carried centuries old grudge against the Hanafi
                            Muslims who held both temporal and spiritual powers in succession for more than 500 years
                            after the death of the Holy Prophet (May peace of God be on him). Although it was an age-old
                            grudge but. As Islamic history shows they utterly failed in all their designs to destroy
                            their rivals. Islam has survived many vicissitudes of history and Quran has promised its
                            survival up to the last Day-of-Judgment.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life > Defeat Of Sultan

                            In spite of all his best efforts to turn out the invaders from his country and to control
                            the internal rebels, Sultan Sanjar unfortunately could not succeed. He was engulfed in
                            mutual wars between himself and his unfaithful brothers on the one hand, and the Fidayees
                            and barbarous Tartars on the other. It was indeed a terrible situation for him, yet they
                            fought the forces of evil to the bitter end though he was ultimately defeated and had to run
                            for his life.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life > General Massacre

                            After the defeat of Sultan Sanjar, the invaders had a free hand to plunder every town in
                            Khorasan. Flourishing fields were destroyed, cities were razed to the ground, inhabitants,
                            Ulama and Sufis were mercilessly murdered honour of the woman was brutally outraged, girls
                            and boys were taken as salves mosques, hospitals and the historic educational institutions
                            were destroyed.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life >Destruction Of Neshapur

                            When the news of this terrible destruction reached the defeated sultan, he once more summed
                            up his courage and collected his shattered army to save his country. But Sultan Sanjar was
                            born under most unlucky stars and his luck once more betrayed him. He failed to check the
                            invaders and this time he was arrested. When this bad news reached Neshapur, the capital was
                            plunged into indescribable grief. It was now at the mercy of the enemy. The invaders entered
                            Khorasan and destroyed the cities of Tus and Mashhed, reaching Neshapur like a sweeping
                            storm. Everything was destroyed leaving this once flourishing city of Islamic culture and
                            learning into a heap of rubble and ruin.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life > Death Of Khawaja’s Parents

                            Khawaja Muinuddin again saw all this ghastly drama at his early age. But this was not all
                            for him. Just at this time he lost his dear father (551 AD) and the worst part of it was
                            that he had already lost his dear mother too. The young orphan was now left all alone to
                            take care of himself in a world full of hate, murder and greed. Although by virtue of legacy
                            he had enough material resources to sustain himself in his traditional standard of life but
                            the sack of Neshapur coupled with the death of his dear parents plunged him into deep
                            thinking. At times he was over whelmed with grief and saw a very vague picture of this
                            terrible world though he bore it out with courage and exemplary forbearance. He was a hard
                            working youth and looked after his orchard, personally trimming and watering the plants with
                            his own hands.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life > Yet Another Shock

                            Hardly a year had passed after the death of Khawaja Muinuddin’s father, when the mischievous
                            Tartars once more ransacked Khorasan and repeated the same bloody drama of murder arson and
                            loot. This time Sultan Mahmood, one of the brothers of Sultan Sanjar, came forward to check
                            the invaders but he too failed to rout them. Neshapur was again the scene of the same
                            ghastly tragedies. And once more Khawaja Muinuddin was overwhelmingly dismayed to see these
                            scenes of terrible devastation. He often plunged himself into deeper thoughts about these
                            ugly events in order to try to come to some definite conclusion about his own future course
                            of life. The thought of helping the helpless humanity against all such persistent pillage
                            always tormented his tender heart. Yet they could not come to any definite conclusion.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life > Destined For A Sacred Mission

                            As helpless human beings, we can never understand the will of the Almighty God. Should we
                            surmise that by exhibiting these tragedies perhaps God Almighty meant to show Khawaja
                            Muinuddin the sins of this wretched world in order to prepare him for a mighty divine
                            mission of reform and peace for the mankind? As it will be seen later on that Heavenly
                            Father did mean this for which He enlightened the mind of the young Khawaja quite
                            unexpectedly. Whenever injustice, oppression and greed reigned supreme in this world, God
                            has always been merciful to mankind by sending His saviours to fight the satanic forces and
                            put the people on the path of righteousness and mutual love.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Birth And Early Life >Khawaja Sahib’s Genealogy And Childhood

                            Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty was one of the descendants of the illustrious family of
                            Hazrat Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of the Holy Prophet Mohammed (May peace of God be on
                            him). His father Syed Ghiyasuddin Hasan was a very pious personality and a well to do and
                            influential gentleman. His mother, Syeda Bibi Ummul-wara alias Babi Mah-e-Noor was the
                            daughter of Syed Daud. While Khawaja Muinuddin’s paternal genealogy is traced from Hazrat
                            Imam Husain, the younger son of Hazrat Ali Karam Allah Wajahu, his maternal genealogy is
                            traced from Hazrat Imam Hasan, the elder son of Hazrat Ali.

                            Childhood

                            According to historians, Khwaja Muinuddin Chishty even during his childhood gave early
                            promise of his rare piety and sacrifice for others. Whenever any woman with a baby came to
                            see his mother and if the baby cried for feeding,”the infant saint of the future” used to
                            make a sign to his mother to feed the crying baby from her own breast. When his mother did
                            this, the spectacle pleased the little Muinuddin very much. At the age of 3 or 4 he used to
                            share his own food with his playmates.

                            Once he was going to Idgah for the Id prayers in rich clothes. On the way he saw a blind boy
                            in rags. He pitied the boy so much that he at once gave him some of his own clothes and led
                            him to Idgah with all due affection.

                            Renouncement

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation

                            Khawaja Muinuddin used to ponder for hours together over the ugly scenes of the ghastly
                            massacre in Khorasan which he had been witnessing with great pain for several years ever
                            since his younger days. With these tragic impressions his interest in worldly life and
                            pleasures was diminishing fast. Inwardly he was very much worried and longed to be away from
                            such a mad world if he could manage to see a way out.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation > Renouncement

                            One day (in 556 AD), he came across a ‘Majzoob’ (a divine person constantly engrossed in
                            communion with God) in the person of one Sheikh Ibrahim Qandozi who happened to come to his
                            orchard. The young Khawaja Muinuddin was watering the plants at that time. Immediately he
                            saw the dervish, he welcomed him enthusiastically and after kissing his hands reverently
                            made him sit down under a shady tree. He then brought a bunch of fresh grapes and requested
                            the holy man to eat it. The request was complied with. The divine seemed to admire the
                            manners and this gesture of the young Khawaja’s hospitality and at once perceived, by his
                            intuitive powers, that his host was inwardly worried and upset, had a spark of divine love
                            in his heart and was an ardent seeker after Truth. Over whelmed by the pleasure of this
                            understanding the dervish brought out a bit of ‘Khul’ (the substance left after the oil was
                            extracted from the sesame seed or Til – some historians say it was a piece of bread) from
                            his wallet and after chewing it put it in the mouth of Khawaja Muinuddin. No sooner had he
                            eaten it, than the veil of all worldly imagination was lifted from his mind and he found
                            himself in quite a strange world radiating with ‘divine manifestation.’ When Khawaja
                            Muinuddin recovered from this extraordinary experience, he found that Sheikh Ibrahim Qandozi
                            had gone.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation>Not A Fable

                            This strange spiritual experience, which laid the foundation of Khawaja Muinuddin’s divine
                            career, would look like a queer fable from the Arabian Nights to the present world engrossed
                            in materialism. But it is neither a fable nor a dream because such miracles have happened
                            with the spiritualists or Sufi dervishes or Rishis and Munis of the highest order in the
                            East. And they do happen even today if one is lucky enough to come across any ‘real’ divine
                            (who prefers to live in perpetual obscurity away from all worldly gaze to avoid interruption
                            in his devotional career). Such miracles are amply supported by the old religious books or
                            Scriptures of nearly all the leading and recognised religions of the world all of which are
                            based on spiritualism. The people of this 20th century in which materialism overwhelmingly
                            dominates spiritualism may ridicule and refuse to believe in such superhuman feats and may
                            naturally demand some substantial logical or scientific proofs to support them. But such
                            doubts can be easily dispelled by a minute study of their own respective religious
                            Scriptures. The philosophies of Islamic Sufism and the ancient Yogic and Vedantic sciences
                            of Hindu civilisation also help us to believe in such miracles unquestionably. In this
                            hidden science of spiritual communion or oneness with God all logical arguments are
                            deliberately rejected because logic and Sufism do not go hand-in-hand, which was the creed
                            of Khawaja Muinuddin and numerous other great Sufis and saints of the East. It is neither
                            taught in our modern Universities nor can it be analysed in our scientific laboratories. It
                            is Knowledge from God that comes to His “beloved” devotees only.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation>Departure for Bokhara

                            The immediate inspiration of the above-mentioned miraculous experience with Sheikh Ibrahim
                            Qandozi was that Khawaja Muinuddin renounced the world. He lost no time in selling away his
                            orchard and the windmill along with all his other worldly belongings and distributed every
                            pie of the sale proceeds among the poor and the needy. He then cut off all his ties with his
                            dear and near ones, bade them a last goodbye and left Neshapur for Bokhara, which was the
                            seat of learning in those days in search of religious knowledge and moral education.

                            A handsome youth who had renounced the world in his early teens was seen walking all alone
                            on the Neshapur-Bokhara highway amidst jungle and animal life, without a friend without a
                            penny in his pocket and without any present or future hope of provision for his livelihood
                            resolutely determined to seek Truth. The ever-growing discontentment of his earlier years in
                            spite of all his rich traditions and material possessions had suddenly changed into a
                            perfect contentment immediately after a divine vision received through the help of a great
                            ‘Majzoob’. He seemed to be very happy with his apparently gloomy lot. At this stage, however
                            he did not know that one day he would be one of the greatest holy saints and ‘Mujaheds’ of
                            his day in the history of Islam who would turn the tables of the evil world, who would apply
                            the balm of solace and salvation to the wounds of the afflicted humanity and who would cause
                            downfall of the redeem the suffering of the oppressed? This youthful traveler in a
                            friendless world was none but Khawaja Muinuddin playing in the hands of Destiny for a
                            exceedingly grand mission and amazing career dedicated to the cause of peace and happiness
                            of mankind.

                            This illustrious son of Islam and dutiful servant of the oppressed humanity, had decided to
                            go to Bokhara for his education because the famous oriental universities of Baghdad and
                            Neshapur had suffered damage due to the ravages of continuous wars and plunder but Bokhara
                            had still some of the best educational institutions and the learned ‘Ulama’ of his time.

                            Nothing is recorded by historians about Khawaja Muinuddin’s primary education but
                            considering his noble heritage; it is safe to presume that he must have received at least
                            his early Quranic lessons at home. One historian reports that he had learned Quran by heart
                            at the age of 7.

                            While in Bokhara, Khawaja Muinuddin received his education in all the oriental sciences and
                            literature from many learned ‘Ulama’ of the day, prominent of whom was Maulana Hissamuddin
                            Bokhari from whom he received his ‘jubba’ (cloak) and ‘Dastaar-e-Fazilat’ (turban of
                            learning) the two highest academic diplomas or “robes of learning” of that time.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation>At Samaqand

                            Having completed his education at Bokhara, Khawaja Muinuddin went to Samarqand which was
                            also a great seat of learning in those days. There too he attended many leading institutions
                            to perfect his knowledge in Theology, Philosophy and Grammar. The years of his education in
                            Bokhara and Samarqand are reported to be between 1150 and 1160 AD or 552 AH.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation>In Quest For A Spritual Preceptor

                            After equipping himself with all the best available education (moral and religious) which he
                            could obtain, Khawaja Muinuddin now diverted his attention to the spiritual side of his
                            training. He now needed a ‘spiritual preceptor’ and decided to leave Samarqand in quest of
                            the country towards Baghdad. On this journey he came to the town of Harwan or Haroon where
                            one of the greatest Sufi dervishes of his time Hazrat Khawaja Usman Harooni, lived. (Born
                            510 A.H. died 617 A.H. and buried at Mecca.) This great saint had a resounding fame which
                            attracted scores of persons from far and near for their spiritual enlightenment and
                            religious and moral training under him.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation>At the feet of Murshid

                            One day Khawaja Muinuddin decided to present himself before this great saint. When he
                            approached the saint, he kissed the ground with all due reverence and pleaded: “Sir, may I
                            request you to enlist man as one of your humble and devoted ‘mureeds’ (disciples)’? Hazrat
                            Khawaja Usman at once perceived by his intuitive powers that Muinuddin was the fittest
                            candidate to join the circle of his disciples, and granted his request without hesitation.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) > Renouncement And Initiation>Initiation

                            Khawaja Muinuddin says, in his own words, about his spiritual initiation “I had the honour
                            of appearing before Hazrat Usman when many other spiritual luminaries were also present. I
                            bowed my head in solemn reverence. Hazur Usman asked me to offer 2 ‘rakaats’ of Namaaz
                            (prayers). I did it. He then directed me to sit facing the Kaaba (Mecca). I did it. He told
                            me to repeat Darud Sharif (praise and blessings for the holy prophet and his family) 21
                            times and to say ‘Subhan Allah’ (God be praised) 60 times. I did it. After that he stood up
                            took my hand in his own and looked towards the heaven saying: “Let me present you to God”.
                            After that he cut off my hair with a scissors and then put a special Tarki cap (Kolah
                            Chahaar Tarki) on my head and asked me to sit down. He then asked me to repeat ‘Surah
                            Ikhlas’ (a Quranic verse) one thousand times. I did it. He then said, “among our followers
                            there is only one day and one night’s Mujaheda (probation) hence go and do it today”
                            Accordingly I spent one day and one night in prayers and reappeared before him. He asked me
                            to sit down and repeat ‘Surah Ikhlas’ again one thousand times. I did so. “Look towards the
                            heaven”, he then asked me. When I raised my eyes towards the heaven he enquired “how far do
                            you see?” I said, upto Arsh-e-Moalla (zenith). He then asked me “look below” . I said upto
                            Tahtu-Sara (abyss). He then asked me to sit sown and repeat ‘Surah Ikhlas’ one thousand
                            times and I did it. He then asked me ” Look towards the heaven “. When I did so, he enquired
                            “how far do you see now? ” I said upto Hijaab-e-Azmat (dazzling glory of God). He then asked
                            me “close your eyes”. I did so, and, after a moment, he told me “open your eyes.” I did so.
                            Then he showed me his two fingers and enquired “what do you see through them?” I said, I see
                            18,000 Aalam (worlds). When he heard this, he said, “now your work is over”. Then he looked
                            towards a brick lying nearby and asked me to pick it up. When I did so. I found some
                            deenars’ (gold coins) under it. He asked me to go and distribute them among the poor and the
                            needy which I did. I was then instructed to remain with him for some time.”

                            His Days With Murshid

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >His Days With Murshid> At Mecca and Medina

                            Khawaja Muinuddin says he was taken to Kaaba (Mecca) in 562 A.H. from Baghdad by his
                            Murshid, Khawaja Usman, where the master prayed for his disciple’s success and salvation.
                            His prayer was answered by a ‘Nida’ (voice) declaring: ‘O Usman, We have accepted Muinuddin
                            as one of our beloved devotees”. (Hazrat Sheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardy says he was himself
                            present in Mecca when Khawaja Muinuddin Chishti’s attendance took place.) Khawaja Usman then
                            took Khawaja Muinuddin to Medina and asked him to offer his homage and salutations at the
                            shrine of the Holy Prophet Mohammed. In this connection, Khawaja Muinuddin says: “I did so
                            and heard a ‘Nida’ in response declaring: ‘Wa-alaikum-us-Salaam Ya Qutbul
                            Mashaikh-e-bahr-o-bar’ (Peace be on you also O spiritual leader of all the saints on
                            earth”). Upon this Khawaja Usman informed his disciple that he had now reached the stage of
                            perfection as a dervish.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >His Days With Murshid>Strange Experience On Travels

                            Describing his extensive travels with his ‘Pir-o-Murshid’ Khawaja Muinuddin says, “I was
                            once travelling with Hazrat Khawaja Usman in Sewastan. One day we reached a ‘Som-Aa’
                            (monastery) where Hazrat Sadruddin Ahmed Sewastani lived and remained deeply absorbed in the
                            devotion of God. For several days I remained in his attendance. When anybody came to him, he
                            used to get out something from ‘gheb’ (invisible source) and present the same to the
                            newcomer and requested him to pray for the dervish so that he may carry his unflinching
                            faith in God and his holy prophet Mohammed to the grave. Whenever he heard of the torture
                            that awaits the sinful dead in their graves (according to Islamic belief) he used to shiver
                            like a cane even at this horrible thought. He very often bitterly wept for days together and
                            did this so loudly that even the onlookers could not resist their pitiful emotions. When I
                            attended on him, he was in this state of mind. When he recovered he told me, “My dear, I
                            have to face the death. How can one whose enemy is Malik-ul-Maut (the angel of death) and
                            who has to render the account of his worldly deeds or the Day-of-judgement (Qayamat) laugh
                            or be happily engaged in any worldly affairs?” He went on, “If you people ever knew even a
                            little about the condition of those persons who are interned in their graves with scorpions
                            and snakes torturing them you would melt like salt. “Hazrat Sadruddin added, “One day I was
                            sitting with a god fearing dervish in the graveyard of Basrah. By his intuition the divine
                            understood that the internee of a nearby grave was being subjected to questions about his
                            religious belief, etc. (according to Islamic conviction) with horrible torture. On realising
                            the horror of this torture this dervish made a violent ‘Nara’ (loud shriek) and the next
                            moment he was dead. I have never seen a dervish more horrified at the thought of after death
                            questioning and torture of the sinful in their graves than this one. Hazrat Sadruddin
                            further went on, ” It is due to this thought of the horrible torture in grave that I am in
                            seclusion for the past 30 years and you are the first person whom I have related this story.
                            Therefore my dear, it is better to spend our time in the devotion of God than in the company
                            of worldly people because so long as people spend their time in the company of worldly
                            people they are away from God. We must avoid such association and prepare ourselves for the
                            next world. “After this he gave me two ‘ Khurmas’ (dry dates) and retired to his seclusion
                            only to resume his repentance.”

                            Hazarat Khawaja Muinuddin continues, “Once I, Hazrat Khawaja Usman Harooni Shiekh Ahaduddin
                            Kirmani and Janab Aarif Revigiri were sitting in the company of some other dervishes in
                            mosque of Damascus. In the course of conversation Janab Mohammed Arif said; “ On the
                            day-of-judgement (Qaya- mat) the rich will have to finish an account of their doings and
                            conduct before God but the dervishes will be exempted.” One of the dervishes however
                            hesitated to believe this and demanded an authority on such a divine ‘fireman’ from an
                            authentic book. After a little contemplation, Janab Arif gave out ‘Kashful-Mahjoob’ as the
                            name of the book but the dervish insisted to see the said book and the ‘firam’ with his own
                            eyes. Upon this Janab Aarif prayed to the Almighty God for help and by His grace the angels
                            presented the particular book to him. When it was shown to the arguing dervish he bowed down
                            his head at the feet of Janab Aarif apologetically. Afterwards it was decided that each of
                            the 4 dervishes present should show his ‘Karamat’ (miracle). Hazrat Usman Harooni put his
                            hand under his ‘Mussalla’ (prayer carpet) and brought out some pieces of gold and asked one
                            of the company present to go and fetch some ‘Halwa’ (a kind of sweet paste prepared with
                            refined flour butter and sugar for all. Shiekh Ahaduddin Kirmani then touched a dead branch
                            of a tree lying nearby which immediately came to life and became green and flourishing.
                            Owing to great regard I had for my ‘murshid’, I did nothing. Hazrat Usman then turned to me
                            and said, “Muinuddin you did nothing”. Upon this I took out 4 fresh breads from my wallet
                            and handed them over to the dervishes who were feeling too hungry but did not express their
                            desire before the company due to shame. Janab Aarif then said, “A dervish who had no such
                            powers did not deserve to be called a dervish. “

                            Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin says, “Once I, Hazrat Usman and another dervish were on a journey
                            when we reached the town of Awash where we met Shiekh Bahauddin Awashi. He was a great
                            dervish and it was his custom that whosoever went to him at his Khanqah (secluded place of
                            meditation), he was offered something. He used to distribute clothes also, which he received
                            from ‘gheb’ (invisible sources). When we left him, he gave me a precious parting advice. He
                            said, “O dervish, whatever you get give it away in charity in the name of Allah and never
                            hoard any wealth. Feed the humble and the poor people of God so that you may become one of
                            His beloved.”

                            Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin continues, “Our next halt was at Badakhshan where we met a
                            venerable old dervish one of whose feet was amputated. He was 100 years old and was wholly
                            absorbed in the devotion of God. When I enquired about his amputated foot, he said, “One
                            day, overpowered by my ‘nafs’ (appetitive desire) I put this foot out of the ‘Som Aa’
                            (monastery) when I heard a ‘nida’ (voice), “O devotee, have you forgotten your pledge with
                            me? I immediately felt ashamed and cut off my foot and threw it away because it had led me
                            out of the ‘Som Aa’ and was the cause of breaking my pledge with God. I do not know how
                            shall I be able to show my face and wipe off this disgrace before other dervishes on the
                            Day-of-Judgement.”

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >His Days With Murshid> Conversion Of Fire Worshippers

                            All historians report a wonderful miracle about Hazrat Khawaja Usman Harooni when he was no
                            one of his tours with Khawaja Muinuddin from Harwan to Baghdad. In the town of Ray, which
                            was a big center of fire-worshippers, they had a big fire temple wherein 20 wagonloads of
                            firewood were consumed daily to keep the fire alive for all the 24 hours. Hazrat Khawaja
                            Usman stayed here under a shady tree. While he engaged himself in his evening prayers, he
                            asked his attendant Fakhruddin to arrange for the fire and prepare some food to end the
                            day’s fast. Fakruddin went to the fire worshippers and begged for some burning coal in order
                            to prepare his fire but they refused and said, “This is our god we cannot give any fire out
                            of it. “The attendant returned and reported the matter to his master. Hazrat Khawaja Usman
                            then himself went and found that an old man, whose name was Mukhtar, was sitting on a raised
                            wooden platform with a 7 year old boy in his lap and many persons were busy in worshipping
                            the fire around him. Hazrat Usman questioned him, “What is the use of worshipping fire which
                            is but an insignificant creation of the Almighty God and which can be extinguished with a
                            little water, why didn’t you worship that real and true God, the Creator of this fire and of
                            all the universe, so that you may derive benefit and have eternal salivation. “The old man
                            replied, “Fire in our religion is very sacred and it is the source of our salvation, we
                            worship it so that it would not burn us on the Day-of-Reckoning.”

                            Hazrat Usman: Very well. Since you have been worshipping it for ages now put your hand in
                            it. If it is a source of your salvation it should not burn you.

                            The Old Man: But burning is the nature of the fire, who can dare to put his hand in it and
                            yet be safe from it?

                            Hazrat Usman: Fire is under the command of the Almighty God, the Creator of the whole
                            universe without His command it cannot burn even a hair.

                            Having said this, Hazrat Usman took the boy from the arms of the old man and reciting,
                            “Bismillah-Ar-Rehman-ir-Rahim-Yaa Naaro kuni bar da-wassalaam-un-ala-Ibrahim” (In the name
                            of merciful and Compassionate God, O fire be thou cool and a means of safety for Abraham)
                            (Quran), he suddenly disappeared in the burning fire. The fire worshippers began to cry and
                            wail. It was after some time that by the grace of God, Hazrat Usman emerged out of the fire
                            quite unscathed with the boy in his arms, hale and hearty. The fire could do them no harm.
                            The old priest and his companions were surprisingly too happy to see the boy safe and sound,
                            and asked him, ” what did you see in the fire? ” The boy replied, “I was playing in a garden
                            because of the blessings of this Sheikh.”

                            All the fire-worshippers, after seeing this miracle, embraced Islam and became Hazrat
                            Khawaja Usman’s devoted disciples. Mukhtar’s name was changed into Abdulla and the boy’s
                            into Ibrahim after the Islamic fashion. Hazrat Usman stayed in Ray for 2 and half years and
                            imparted necessary Islamic teachings and lessons to the new converts. Instead of the fire
                            temple, a magnificent mosque was built in Ray which stands even to this day.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >His Days With Murshid>Punctuality Of Namaz

                            According to Khawaja Muinuddin Chishti, “One day my Murshid Hazrat Usman said “Tomorrow,
                            when the day-of-judgement will come,when all-prophets saints and Muslims will be
                            interrogated by God Almighty about their responsibility to ‘Namaz’ (prayers). Those who have
                            discharged this duty punctually will be spared but those who have not, or who have been
                            lethargic, will be hurled in Waile which is a well in hell and where the punishment is
                            dreadful.”

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >His Days With Murshid>Crossing Of Tigris

                            Recounting another journey with Pir-o-Murshid Hazrat Khawaja Usman, Khawaja Muinuddin says,
                            “We were on a journey, when we reached the bank of the river Tigris, it was horribly
                            overflowing under a furious storm. I was disturbed about crossing it. Hazrat Usman
                            understood my apprehension and asked me to “close the eyes”. I did so. When I opened my eyes
                            after a little while I found him and myself both on the other side of the river. I
                            reverently enquired as to how it happened? The great Murshid said, “We repeated Al-hamd
                            Sharif (Surah Fatiha from the Quran) five times and crossed the river.

                            Succession As Khalifa

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Meeting With Khawaja Qutubuddin

                            During this tour, when he visited the famous city of Asfahan, he met Sheikh Mohammed
                            Asfahani. The 14-year old Qutubuddin Bakhtiyear Awashi (born 569 AH) was in search of a
                            Murshid (Master) in those days and was thinking of approaching Sheikh Mohammed in this
                            matter but, in the meantime he came across Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin who read in him a very
                            promising spiritual career and accepted him as a ‘mureed’. Khawaja Qutubuddin accompanied
                            him on his tour in 583 AH and later on was initiated as Khawaja Sahib’s Khalifa in 586 AH as
                            the result of the ‘Bahsharat’ (prophesy in dream) from the Holy Prophet of Islam at the
                            early age of 17. Khawaja Qutubuddin was a born saint in as much as he had learnt half of the
                            Holy Quran by God’s grace while he was still in his mother’s womb and used to recite it.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Visits To Mecca And Medina

                            During this tour (583-585 AH), Khawaja Muinuddin visited several other places including
                            Mecca, performed Haj and offered incessant prayers for sometime there. One day he heard a
                            ‘Nida’ declaring, “O Muinuddin, we are pleased with you; you may ask anything you like.” The
                            Khawaja Sahib replied, “O Almighty God, I only pray for the grace of your pardon of
                            Muinuddin’s ‘Silsila’ of mureeds”. The ‘Nida’ answered, “O Muinuddin, you are our beloved
                            devotee, we shall pardon your ‘mureeds ‘ and also others who became so in your ‘silsila’
                            upto Qayamat (the Day-of-Reckoning).

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Prophetic Direction To Go To Ajmer

                            Khawaja Muinuddin then went to Medina. There also he remained in devotion for a long time.
                            One night he had a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy Prophet who said, “O Muinuddin
                            you are the promoter of our religion. We give India under your charge where darkness
                            prevails. Go to Ajmer. With your presence, the darkness shall disappear and Islam shall
                            shine. Allah will help you. “Khawaja Muinuddin was much pleased at this ‘Basharat’ but
                            wondered about the geographical situation of Ajmer. In another spiritual communion with the
                            Holy Prophet, he was however shown a map with the exact position of Ajmer with its
                            surrounding hills and the fort.

                            Resuming his journey the Khawaja Sahib visited Khirqan and Sheikh Abul Hasan Khirqani and
                            then Astrabad where he met Shiekh Naasiruddin Astrabadi. He then left for Herat where he
                            stayed at the tomb of Hazrat Abdulla Ansari for some time
                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Yadgar Mohammad’s Conversion

                            When his reputation attracted large number of people in Herat he moved on to Sabzawar in
                            Afghanistan. The governor of this place, named Yadgar Mohammed, was a very cruel and haughty
                            ruler. He was a Baatani and did not recognise or respect the first 3 Caliphs of Islam,
                            neither had he any regard for Sufi dervishes and holy personalities. He owned a fine garden
                            in the suburbs of the town. Hazrat Khawaja Sahib was tired, so he went into the garden for a
                            little rest and, after having a bath in hauz’ (a small reservoir of water), engaged himself
                            in the study of the Holy Quaran.

                            At this time news of the expected arrival of Yadgar Mohammed perturbed the attendant of
                            Khawaja Sahib. Apprehending insult of trespass at the hands of the haughty governor he
                            approached his master and informed, ” Sir, the owner of this garden is coming; I think, we
                            should move out lest he may insult your honour for trespass in his garden.” The Khawaja
                            Sahib merely smiled and said, “If you are so afraid, you may go and sit under that tree and
                            watch the scene of Allah’s wonder. “Immediately after this, Yadgar’s servants appeared on
                            the scene and started sweeping and carpeting of the place for their master’s reception. Due
                            to the extraordinary saintly dignity and awe of Khawaja Sahib, they could not however dare
                            to ask him to get out. In the meantime, Yadgar Mohammed arrived at the scene with his
                            retinue.

                            When he saw Khawaja Muinuddin there, he got wild and vehemently rebuked his servants, “Why
                            did you allow this ‘fakir’ here and did not turn him out of my garden?” On hearing this, the
                            Khawaja Sahib simply raised his eyes (from the Holy Quran which he was reading) towards
                            Yadgar Mohammed and the next moment the proud and haughty governor shivered like a cane and
                            fell down unconscious on the ground. His servants and retinue were thunder struck by this
                            incident and begged Khawaja Sahib to forgive their master for his impertinent behaviour.
                            Upon this the Khawaja Sahib asked his attendant to get some water from the ‘hauz’ and
                            sprinkle the same on Yadgar Mohammed’s face.

                            The next moment he regained consciousness and knelt down at the feel of the saint
                            apologetically. The Khawaja Sahib then delivered a brief sermon of advice to him and his
                            people who repented shamefully for their past sins and wrong convictions. He reminded Yadgar
                            Mohammed that it was highly contradictory and shameful to be a believer of the Holy Prophet
                            on the one hand and to disobey and flout his commands and the Islamic principles on the
                            other. Yadgar Mohammed offered prayers in lieu of his ‘tauba’ (repentance) and pledged
                            strict abstinence for future. He wanted to give all his vast wealth to Khawaja Sahib, but it
                            was contemptuously refused. He was however advised to distribute it among the poor and the
                            needy which he did promptly. He divorced his many wives, freed all his slaves and renouncing
                            the world, became one of the ardent devotees of Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin Chishti.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>In Ghazni

                            From Balakh, Khawaja Muinuddin is reported to have gone to Ghazni at a time when none could
                            have dared to enter that city due to the terrible turmoil and disturbances that prevailed
                            there consequent upon the fall of Sultan Mahmud’s power and the rise of that of the Ghauris.
                            The city was dangerously ablaze and life was unsafe on account of the general massacre,
                            arson and loot. But Khawaja Muinuddin was too big to be afraid of such dangers. If he was
                            afraid of anything on earth he was afraid of the Almighty God alone. In Ghazni he met Hazrat
                            Shamsul-Aarifin Sheikh Abdul Waahid and stayed with him for some time. In the tone and
                            temper of this horrible time in Ghazni, the Khawaja Sahib applied his healing balm of
                            spiritualism to the wounds of the afflicted which was the supreme need of the hour.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Entry In India

                            It was in the year of grace, 587 AH or 1191 AD that Khawaja Muinuddin Chishti entered India
                            and proceeded to Delhi via Fort Shaadman, Multan, Lahore and Samana (a town of the old
                            Patiala state). At Lahore he stayed for 40 days at the shrine of Hazrat Data Ganj Baksh, a
                            great saint who had come to India before Khawaja Sahib and enjoyed considerable respect and
                            popularity in the Punjab. While leaving Lahore, Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin offered the
                            following Persian couplet in appreciation of this great saint:

                            “Ganj bakhsh-e-faize-e-Alam mazhar-e-nur-e-khuda.
                            Naaqisan ra pir-e-kamil Kaamilaan raa naakhuda. ”
                            (Ganj Baksh is a radiant ray of Divinity and a bestower of the treasure of divine knowledge
                            for the salvation of mankind. To the unworthy he is a supreme guide or murshid but to the
                            supreme guides or murshids themselves he is a superlative guide like the captain of a ship.)

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Warning of Raja Prithviraj’s Mother

                            Mother of Raja Prithviraj Chauhan, who ruled Ajmer and Delhi at that time, had warned her
                            son 12 years ago by her astrological knowledge that a ‘fakir’ would enter his kingdom from
                            the North one day and destroy it if he would not be wise enough to respect him and
                            compromise with him. The Raja had therefore, deputed intelligent spies all over the
                            North-Western frontier to watch the expected fakir with a view to foil his entry and finish
                            him before he could do any mischief. When Khawaja Sahib reached Samana (a town of the old
                            Patiala state), the spies were shrewd enough to recognise him and wanted to harm him by
                            intrigue. They invited him to stay with them as their guest and accept their hospitality.
                            But a ‘Basharat’ from the Holy Prophet warned him not to trust them but to continue his
                            journey toward Ajmer.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Courageoues Entry In Delhi

                            A great political event coincided with the journey of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib from Lahore to
                            Delhi. On the decline of Sultan Mahmud’s reign in Ghazni, Sultan Ghiyasuddin Ghauri and his
                            brother Shahabuddin Ghauri had assumed power and captured Lahore from the last Ghazni
                            governor Khusro Shah. Before returning to his capital, Shahabuddin Ghauri was however
                            challenged (after he had captured Bhatinda) by and suffered a crushing defeat at the hands
                            of Raja Prithviraj Chauhan of Ajmer in the first battle of Trawri or Tarain (40 miles from
                            Delhi) in 587 A H or 1191 AD. He escaped miraculously with his wounds by the help of a
                            faithful Khilji slave who carried him safe on his horseback from the battlefield.

                            The Khawaja Sahib on his journey to Delhi met some Khilji and Pathan sepoys-remnants of
                            Shahabuddin Ghauri’s defeated army-who warned the saint not to venture his entry into Delhi
                            at such a dangerous time. But it has always been proved, he was too big for such a warning
                            and despite all natural prejudice against Muslims in such atmosphere he continued his
                            journey courageously towards Delhi.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Succession As Khalifa>Entity & Conversions In Delhi

                            It can be easily surmised that the Khawaja Sahib’s entry in Delhi, under such a prejudiced
                            atmosphere must have taxed his and his few followers courage and perseverance to the utmost
                            capacity specially faith in Allah. And indeed nothing could disturb or prevent him and his
                            resolute mission even when his appearance actually infuriated the inhabitants of Delhi. A
                            citizen’s deputation approached Khandey Rao, the cousin of Raja Prithviraj and governor of
                            Delhi under his regime and easily obtained these orders for the immediate expulsion of
                            Khawaja Sahib and his few companions from Delhi. But whosoever went to execute the order he
                            was so irresistibly over powered and subdued by the great saint’s magnetic personality and
                            affectionate demeanour that he was on the contrary, obliged to listen to Khawaja Sahib’s
                            sermon and embrace Islam instead of evicting him from the site. This was the great saint’s
                            first miracle on the soil of India which killed all the prejudice against his religion
                            surprisingly and converted the same into a deep affection and reverence for him. As this
                            news went round the city, people began to flock around him in ever-increasing number and
                            embraced Islam unhesitatingly. When sufficient seed of Islamic faith was thus scattered in
                            the soil of Delhi the Khawaja Sahib deputed Khawaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki (his beloved
                            Khalifa) to carry on the good work there and himself proceeded to Ajmer.

                            Miracles of Khawaja Gharibnawaz (R.A)

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>Why These Miracles?

                            According to the natural principle of “seeing is believing”, man appreciates and believes
                            quickly a practical demonstration if he sees it with his own eyes instead of being convinced
                            by any other kind of mere theoretical education or appeal for any good cause. There has been
                            no greater and more sacred cause than the cause of religion in the history of mankind.
                            Religious belief has always been a question of strong conviction with humanity, and there
                            can be no perfect or unshakable religious belief without perfect and solemn conviction in
                            the establishment of which nothing but miracles have played a most convincing part.
                            Miracles, as a rule, are rare phenomena emanating from, or performed by, only those
                            superhuman beings who are entrusted with, the sublime service of God and His creation.

                            When man is woefully steeped in sin, he refuses to return to the path of righteousness
                            easily, and ignores all ordinary human appeals for abstinence. He needs something more
                            powerful i.e. some ‘supernatural’ power to convince him that sinful life was contrary to the
                            “Divine Law” and would lead him only to an ignominious disaster and severe penalties in both
                            the worlds if he did not return to virtue. Only divine personalities like the Prophets,
                            Saints and Auvtaars, who have no selfish axe to grind, are capable of performing by the
                            grace of God to uphold the cause of eternal TRUTH for the emancipation of mankind.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>Miracles And Modern Science

                            The votaries of modern science do not believe in miracles. They take them as mere myths.
                            But, in Islam, miracles have the authority of the Holy Quran. They must be believed because,
                            firstly, they actually happen; secondly, because they are incontestable historical facts;
                            and thirdly, because science is only a weapon of sceptics and unbelievers against thing
                            ‘supernatural’. Scientists maintain that except the priest craft and some credulous victims,
                            no intelligent person living in 20th century believers in miracles, which are looked upon as
                            mere fables invented by wily priests maddened by superstition and medieval moonshine. This
                            tempest of mere verbal camouflage is, however, a poor instrument to thrash out the truth
                            about miracles.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>Khawaja Sahib’s Pilgrimage To Mecca Every Year

                            As is evident from his life history Khawaja Moinuddin is reported to have performed two Haj
                            pilgrimages to Mecca before coming out to India. But the Hajis (pilgrims who visit Mecca
                            during the Haj) who undertook pilgrimage to Mecca during Khawaja Sahib’s stay in Ajmer bore
                            evidence to the fact on their return to Indian that they saw the great saint in Mecca
                            personally during the Haj every year. It was indeed one of his marvellous miracles. How
                            could he do this feat in the absence of any modern means of transport 700 years ago, is a
                            mystery beyond human perception and yet it is a fact corroborated by eye witness and
                            history. During the Haj period, he was seen both in Ajmer and Mecca.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>Murderer Becomes A Devotee

                            Once a person appeared before Hazrat Khawaja Sahib and pretended to say that he was eager to
                            pay his homage to the great saint on that particular day. The Khawaja Sahib replied “Here I
                            am, but first fulfil your promise that brings you here”. The man began to tremble with the
                            idea that his secret was out before he could act and, admitting his guilt, he at once
                            offered his profound apologies. As a matter of fact, this man was a hireling of some of the
                            enemies of Hazrat Khawaja and had come with theprecise intention of murdering the holy
                            saint, a fact which the great saint came to know by his intuitive powers. The man prayed for
                            the pardon of the saint who forgave him magnanimously. The men then embraced Islam and
                            became one of the devoted `mureeds’ of Khawaja Moinuddin for the rest of his life.
                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>Milk From An Immature Cow?

                            One day Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty was sitting on the bank of the Ana-sagar lake at Ajmer. A
                            shepherd-boy happened to pass before him with a herd of young cows who had not yet acquired
                            their maturity. The Khawaja Sahib asked the boy for some milk from his herd. The boy took it
                            to be a joke and said, “Baba they are all young calf of immature age; they do not yield any
                            milk at this age.” The Khawaja Sahib smiled and, pointing towards a young cow, said, “I
                            would like to drink the milk of that cow, go and milk her.” The boy obeyed rather
                            hesitatingly. When he went to milk this particular cow, he was simply astonished to find her
                            teats fully developed and over-flowing with milk. The boy filled several receptacles with
                            milk which 40 persons drank to their full satisfaction. He was so much impressed by this
                            strange miracle that he became great devotee of Khawaja Sahib.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>A Prediction

                            One day, ‘mureed’ (disciple) of Khawaja Sahib came to him and complained, “Sir, the governor
                            of the city has made my life most miserable by intolerable harassment so much so that today
                            he has order my banishment from the city.” The Khawaja Sahib replied, “But where is he now,
                            he has already been punished by God?” When the man returned to his home, he heard the news
                            of the governor’s sudden death due to a fall from his horse while hunting.

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>Restoration Of Murdered Man

                            One day a waiting old woman came to Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin who was busy with his ‘wazoo’
                            (ablution). The woman complained that the governor of the city had murdered her son without
                            any fault and that she had come to him to beg for justice. The Khawaja Sahib, after
                            finishing with his ‘wazoo’ picked up his ‘asa-e-mubarak’ (holy staff) and went out with the
                            old lady to go to the place where the murdered corpse of her son was lying. His close
                            devotees also followed him in attendance. The Khawaja Sahib placed the severed heard in its
                            proper position on the body of the murdered young man and prayed to the Almighty God, “O
                            Allah, if this man was murdered with any fault, then grant him his life”. After this prayer,
                            the Khawaja Sahib put his staff on the corpse and said, “Get up by the command of Allah if
                            you are innocent.” The young man got up, hale and hearty, and the next moment both he and
                            his old mother fell down at the feet of the great saint of Ajmer in solemn gratitude

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Karamat (Miracles)>To The Rescue Of Sheikh Ali

                            One day Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin was passing through a street of Ajmer with his attendant
                            Sheikh Ali. Suddenly a creditor of Sheikh Ali appeared on the scene and, holding him by his
                            garment insisted upon the payment of his debt in a very insolent manner. Pleading on behalf
                            of his attendant, the Great Khawaja assured the creditor that his debt would now be paid
                            soon and requested him to let Sheikh Ali go for the time being. But the creditor would not
                            allow the attendant to move until his money was paid on the spot. This obduracy at last
                            invoked Khawaja Sahib’s proverbial sympathy for human shortcomings. In a state of ‘jazba’
                            (intense feeling) he took off his ‘Chadar’ (the wrapper which he wore) and flung the same on
                            to the ground. And as soon as the ‘Chadar’ was flung, it was covered with a big heap of
                            precious silver and gold coins. The Khawaja Sahib then asked the creditor, “Please take away
                            your debt, counting honestly as much as it is due to you, from this heap but be careful not
                            to pick up even a single coin more than what is your legitimate due.” Overpowered by greed
                            at the sight of such a vast wealth, the creditor mischievously thought of picking up more
                            than what was actually due to him. But as soon as he stretched his hand towards the money
                            with this evil intention, it dried up and his arm became as stiff as an iron rod. The
                            creditor and the onlookers were wonder-struck at this awful experience. Realising his guilt,
                            the creditor fell at the feet of the great saint and begged for mercy. The Khawaja Sahib
                            accepted the man’s apology with his characteristic benevolence and prayed to God for the
                            restoration of his arm to its normal condition.

                            Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty arrived in Ajmer at the age of 52 in 587 AH or 1191 AD on
                            his divine mission, unique in the annals of Islam and also in the history of India. As we
                            have seen, for the success of his grand mission he had already been suitably trained by his
                            Pir-o-Murshid Hazrat Khawaja Usman Harooni and divinely equipped by the blessings of the
                            Holy Prophet Mohammed. He was thus an apostle of God dedicated to the cause of Truth which
                            “always and invariably prevails though in the long run.” His only armour for the success of
                            his great mission was that greatest invisible power that pervades and sustains the whole
                            universe.

                            Truth Always Prevails

                            Again and again through all successive ages, the apostles of God have successfully fought
                            and defeated the forces of evil. Prophet David succeeded in overthrowing Goliath. Prophet
                            Abraham survived the torture of a huge fire made by Namrood to destroy him but it turned
                            into a garden of fragrant flowers and Namrood himself was destroyed by a gnat. Shree
                            Ramchandra, the exiled but dutiful son of Raja Dashratha secured a mighty victory over
                            Ravana the demon king of Ceylon, in righteous cause. In spite of all torture, the Holy
                            Christ and his religion did survive even after his crucifixion and the Holy Prophet gave
                            noble lessons of Christianity to the world. Prophet Mohammed was tormented by Abu Jehal and
                            Abu Lehab with superior forces but he succeeded triumphantly in the end with his grand
                            religious mission. The whole history of the world is replete with such illuminating and
                            noble examples of the success of ‘Truth’ against evil and repeats itself again and again.
                            Whenever and wherever there is a struggle between Truth and falsehood the former is
                            ultimately a victor. Raja Prithvi Raj of Ajmer unfortunately adopted a false policy of
                            arrogance, persecution and insult against a harmless dervish and had to go down before the
                            divine dispensation of the Almighty God.

                            Natural & Inevitable

                            Whenever the ‘Divine will’ ordains to inspire a band of righteous people to work as
                            “Torchbearers of Truth” to a corrupt humanity, there never fails to appear a band of those
                            diehards who pitch themselves in deadly opposition to inflict on the victims all sorts of
                            tortures and troubles. Truth and Righteousness come out all the more shining when tried and
                            tested by hardships and such a period of adversity cannot also fail to bring out the best
                            character in the martyrs, their patience fortitude, humiliation unflinchingly faith, etc. In
                            fact they live if they can for the Truth and die, if they must for the Truth. Moral
                            perfection can be attained and moral virtue can reach their highest standard of persecution.
                            And the ultimate success after fighting against odds, goes to prove beyond all doubt how the
                            “Divine Movement ” and the Divine help and guidance work behind it. Their severe trials are
                            so to say, a blessing in disguise. In the furnace of trials and persecution the one of
                            character becomes burnished gold. Adversity and hardships bring out some of the finest
                            qualities in man. They either make of him an everlasting character, the light which shall
                            shine always and everywhere or reduce him to nothingness and oblivion. Therefore those who
                            aspire after success must be prepared to tread the road of hardships and trials.

                            Greatest Preacher Of Islam In India

                            It is a historic fact that Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty was the greatest preacher and
                            founder of Islam in India. It was he who laid the real foundation of Islam in India by his
                            peaceful mission and unparalleled forbearance. He brought the message of ‘Universal Love and
                            Peace’ and paved the way for his succeeding Khalifas for the peaceful propagation of Islam
                            in this country without any compulsion whatsoever in the true spirit of the Holy Quran which
                            says, “Let there be no compulsion in religion. Wilt thou compel men to become believers? No
                            soul can believe but by the persuasion of God.” Khawaja Moinuddin followed this dictum
                            through out his mission. Before his arrival, Muslims in India were in a most negligible
                            minority. His piety and sympathetic preaching made a profound impression upon all he came
                            across.

                            The invasions of Mohammed-bin-Qasim and Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni contrary to general belief,
                            did little or nothing for any real or permanent promotion of Islam in India. They were more
                            or less military campaigns for the economic exploitation like the British and bear no
                            comparison whatsoever with the grand mission of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin who did wonders
                            with his peaceful preaching of Islam in this country. He did not bring any armies with him
                            but came with only a few companions; he feared none on earth except Allah. He did not come
                            out to conquer the wealth of India, he came out to endear and win the hearts of Indian
                            people by free conviction in order to put them on the right path of “Truth and Love” and
                            thus give them happiness and prosperity in life and salvation after death.

                            Here was the God’s chosen man for a particular mission at a particular period of history
                            Khawaja Moinuddin had renounced the world at an early age and braved self-imposed
                            mortification and contentment when he could have easily lulled himself in a luxurious life
                            on the rich traditions of his illustrious family. But, like all other great prophets and
                            redeemers of the oppressed world his heart ached at the persecution and suffering which the
                            barbarous man perpetrated upon his innocent fellow beings. Here was the man of destiny who
                            was a penniless and friendless orphan when he renounced the world and left Neshapur in quest
                            of education. And yet by exemplary self-denial and diligent industry, he was able to obtain
                            the highest moral and religious training at the leading institutions of Samarqand and
                            Bokhara.

                            Miracles & Sufi Derveshes

                            The ‘Karamaat’ or miracles, which formed a most prominent part of Khawaja Moinuddin life and
                            mission, have always been intimately associated with the lives of other Sufi saints and
                            Hindu seers in the East. As a matter of fact, miracles emanate from the supernatural powers
                            bestowed upon these holy persons by God as the result of their life long devotion, probation
                            (Mujahedas) and trials, and are beyond the scope of common conception of ordinary human
                            beings, their experiences and knowledge. Modern science and logic have no place in the
                            ‘hidden’ calculation and determination of miracles. They are displayed only when there is a
                            great emergency to justify them. In fact they are used as a `last remedy’ when all other
                            common sense persuasion failed to convince the devil in man or the teachings and principles
                            of the divine doctrines of Truth or the laws of God, in order to maintain a harmonious
                            equilibrium among mankind in the “Divine Scheme of God.” so essential for the happiness of
                            His creation on earth. Highly talented and enlightened Sufis and seers are extremely few and
                            rare in this age. They are ranked as Walees in Muslim terminology who as the lives of
                            Khawaja Moinuddin and others of his most distinguished order prove, were obliged to use
                            their supernatural powers to meet the circumstances of each situation strictly in accordance
                            with the divine law and will in the cause of Truth and nothing else.

                            Round the Anasagar lake where the Khawaja Sahib’s party was camping there were many temples.
                            The followers of the saint used to draw water and sometimes catch the fish also from this
                            lake for their food. The Brahman priests of these temples naturally remonstrated against
                            this and reported the matter to the Raja who ordered immediate removal of “these Muslim
                            fakirs” from the place. The servants of the Raja not only demanded Khawaja Sahib’s movement
                            from this place but also asked him to leave Ajmer at once, and this demand was made in very
                            insolent and unbecoming manner. But it was impossible for Khawaja Sahib to agree because he
                            was there by the will of God and the command of his Holy Prophet of Islam. When the rude
                            crowd of Brahmans tried to mob and molest these innocent fakirs with the ultimate intention
                            of murdering them the Khawaja Sahib only threw some dust upon them which forced them not
                            only to shrink back but caused the loss of their senses and vitality also.

                            Persistent Prejudice & Attacks

                            The priests had carried the news of palpable miracles to Raja Prithviraj who naturally got
                            furious in spite of his mother’s warning to control his temper. She reminded him calmly of
                            her 12-year-old prophecy about the entry of a fakir in his kingdom and warned him to treat
                            the dervish with restraint if he wanted to preserve his kingdom. But the warning did not
                            pacify the Raja. He lost no time in summoning one of his most trusted councilors, Ajaipal,
                            (who was also his spiritual ‘guru’) for an urgent conference. Ajaipal was recognised to be
                            the greatest exponent of the sciences of black art magic and witchcraft, astronomy,
                            astrology, and the like. He also expounded these sciences to many hundreds of his chelas
                            (disciples). When he heard the news of Khawaja Sahib’s miracles, he assured the Raja not to
                            worry at all and informed him that this fakir was only a fake juggler of occult sciences and
                            that he would turn him out of Ajmer without any difficulty. He advised Prithviraj to go to
                            the fakir with his bodyguard, promising to follow him very soon with his own army of chelas
                            and the necessary paraphernalia of his witchcraft etc. to meet the emergency.

                            Ajapal’s Magic Attacks

                            While on his way to Khawaja Sahib, Prithviraj fired by his lingering wrath, thought of
                            hurting the saint terribly but as soon as this evil thought occurred, he lost his vision and
                            could not move forward. But when he recollected his mother’s pacifying warning to treat the
                            fakir reverently his heart suddenly softened and he regained his eyesight. By the time he
                            actually appeared before the saint, he had such miraculous experiences no less than 7 times.
                            At last when he reached Anasagar, he was encouraged to see Ajaipal also arriving at the spot
                            in time with his promised troop of disciples.

                            Strange Experience

                            Ajaipal immediately started one of his magical attacks upon the unarmed and peaceful saint
                            whose few followers got frightened for a while. To ward off their fear, the Khawaja Sahib
                            asked them to draw a circle on the ground around their party for protection against
                            Ajaipal’s magical attacks which produced horrible scenes.

                            First of all, Ajaipal made a violent attack through a whirlwind of “chakras” (a sharpedged
                            disc that terribly revolved in the air and cut everything it touched). But instead of
                            harming the Khawaja Sahib and his party, these hundreds of Chakras, whirling violently in
                            the air only reacted back on Ajakpal’s own men and caused no harm to the saint’s party.

                            The attacks which followed were more dreadful than the first. But these could do not a bit
                            of harm to the small party of God’s innocent fakirs. On the contrary, they did a lot of
                            damage in the ranks of Ajaipal’s men.

                            Frustrated by his Chela’s persistent failures, Ajaipal now made a last desperate bid in
                            order to regain his damaged prestige in the eyes of his people by trying a masterpiece of
                            his magical art. He enquired Khawaja Sahib of his position in the realm of the spiritual
                            world. The saint replied, “Let us first see what status you hold in your spiritual world?
                            After that God willing we shall also show you our position.”

                            It was now a lost game for Ajaipal and he surrendered himself to the mercy of Khawaja Sahib
                            finally. While Ajaipal was the redoubtable master of all the evil science of his day, the
                            Khawaja Sahib was only a humble devotee of none but the all-powerful the all pervading and
                            the Almighty God of the universe.

                            Ajaipals Attacks

                            Having lost his battles, Ajaipal now embraced Islam, and became one of Khawaja Sahib’s
                            devoted disciples. He now requested the saint to show his unique position in the realm of
                            the spiritual world as promised by him and wonderland of the 7th heaven through Khawaja
                            Sahib’s spiritual powers which had no limit. Amazed at the wonderful powers of Khawaja
                            Sahib, Ajaipal aspired to have an ‘eternal life’ so that he could gain time to seek God’s
                            pardon for his past sins. He begged the saint to have this wish fulfilled and the Khawaja
                            Sahib did pray to the Almighty God accordingly. The prayer was granted on the condition that
                            Ajaipal’s spirit will remain immortal only for the service of mankind, although he will not
                            be seen in his mortal form which must decay in due course of time under the unchangeable
                            Divine Law. Although Ajaipal died in 694 AH and cannot be seen in his mortal form but his
                            immortal spirit, according to a legend exists for the service of humanity even to this day.
                            This immortal spirit is known as Abdulla Bayabani, a name given to him by Khawaja Shaib.

                            Now that so many people embraced Islam and had become Khawaja Muinuddin’s devoted followers,
                            they requested the saint to shift from Anasagar hill to the former’s house in the city-the
                            site of the saint’s present shrine-to enable the citizens of Ajmer to derive best advantage
                            from his divine preaching. The Khawaja Sahib agreed to this suggestion and his missionary
                            work began to flourish here so much so that within a short time thousands of people from the
                            surrounding districts of Ajmer embraced Islam.

                            Married Life

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Married Life

                            How could a great Sufi saint, who had renounced all worldly pleasures in his early ‘teens’,
                            ever think of a married life? Yet Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty was obliged to marry twice at a
                            very advanced age under Islamic Shariat at the commandment of the Holy Prophet. Throughout
                            his blooming youth he was devoutly engaged in his difficult spiritual training under his
                            Pir-o-Murshid, Hazrat Khawaja Usman Harooni, as a whole time devotee. The Sufis, leading a
                            strictly austere and religious life, generally denied matrimony; their only object of life
                            being complete renunciation and staunch dedication to God in the service of Islam and
                            humanity

                            First Marriage

                            When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his
                            marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or
                            1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You
                            should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim
                            under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat
                            Khawaja Sahib gave his sister Bibi Ummutulla to marry him.

                            Second Marriage

                            Once again the Khawaja Sahib was asked to marry (in 620 AH or 1223 AD) Bibi Asmat, daughter
                            of Syed Wajihuddin Mashhadi who was the commissioner of Ajmer since Qutubuddin Aibak’s
                            regime.

                            Maulana Ahmed, who was a Khadim (attendant) of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, states that Syed
                            Wajihuddin Mashadi had a grown up daughter. He was worried about her marriage, as no
                            suitable match was available. One night Hazrat Imam Jafar gave him this, `basharat’, `O Son,
                            it is the commandment of the Holy Prophet that you should marry your daughter to Sheikh
                            Moinuddin.’ Syed Wajihuddin mentioned this to Hazrat Khawaja Sahib and he replied, “Although
                            I am now too old to marry, but the commandment of the Holy Prophet must be obeyed. I accept
                            this relation.” And so the Khawaja Sahib married a second time.

                            Children From Both Wives

                            It is an irrefutable fact that Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty had three sons and one daughter,
                            viz. Khawaja Fakhruddin, Khawaja Hissamuddin, Khawaja Ziaddin Abu Sayeed and Bibi Hafiza
                            Jamal.

                            It is generally agreed that Khawaja Ziauddin Abu Sayeed was born of Bibi Asmat while Khawaja
                            Fakhruddin, Khawaja Hissammuddin and Bibi Hafiza Jamal from Bibi Ummatulla Hazrat Syed
                            Mahmud Gesudraz of Gulbarga and his group of Sufis are, however, of the opinion that both
                            the later sons were also born of Bibi Asmat, but Maulana Shamsuddin Taher and his group
                            maintain that they were born of Bibi Ummatulla.

                            Khawaja Sahib’s Sons

                            Khawaja Fakhruddin, the eldest son of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, was a great dervish and followed
                            strictly in the footsteps of his illustrious father. He spent most of his time in spiritual
                            development with Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia of Delhi who was himself a great and well-known
                            Sufi dervish. He adopted agriculture as his profession and lived in a village (Mandal) near
                            Ajmer. He is reported to have died in 1265 AD and is buried at Sarwar, 37 miles from Ajmer
                            on the Ajmer-Kekri Road which is an attraction to hundreds of pilgrims during his Urs every
                            year

                            Khawaja Hissammuddin, the second son of Hazrat Sahib, is reported to have disappeared in his
                            early age. All that is known of him is that he died in 1255 AD. He is said to have acquired
                            the stage of an “abdaal” (certain holy person by whom God continues the world in existence,
                            according to Islamic belief.)

                            Khawaja Ziauddin Abu Sayeed, the 3rd son of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, left two sons of whom
                            nothing is further known. He was buried in the precincts of Khawaja Sahib’s Dargah at Ajmer
                            and died at the age of 50.

                            The Khawaja Sahib’s only daughter, Bibi Hafiza Jamal was a very pious lady and had leaned
                            Quran by heart at the age of 7. She was married to Sheikh Raziuddin son of Sultan-ul-Tarikin
                            Hazrat Khawaja Hameed-ud-din Nagauri; a saintly dervish who lies buried at Nagaur in Jodhpur
                            district. She was buried in a tomb on the south of Khawaja Sahib’s shrine at Ajmer. Both
                            Bibi Asmat and bibi Ummatulla are also buried in the precincts of the Dargah of Khawaja
                            Sahib at Ajmer.

                            Death Of Khawaja Saheb

                            The passing away of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin (may peace of god be upon his soul) from this
                            world to the next which took place on 6th of Rajab 633 AH (1233 AD) at the ripe age of 97
                            was also one of the greatest mysteries of his life.

                            It goes without saying that by virtue of his divine life Khawaja Moinuddin is immortal. In
                            the past 750 years, millions of people of all classes and faiths inspired by his love and
                            pious preaching, are attracted to his shrine from all over the world to pay their loving
                            homage and receive his ungainly blessings to solve their problems. Such a devotion has never
                            been offered to the tomb of any the mightiest monarchs of the world and it is a rare
                            distinction in the history of Islam and Sufism.

                            The life and mission of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin have been of an exceptional character as
                            compared to any other saints of India. His simple teachings penetrated even stony hearts,
                            his affectionate looks tamed his fiercest enemies, his matchless piety and blessings knew no
                            distinction and his spiritual amazed and defied his bitterest adversaries who came to harm
                            him but were compelled to embrace Isalm and become his devotees for the rest of their lives.
                            These exceedingly rare gifts are bestowed by the Almighty God only upon his “chosen few”
                            whom He deputes to reform mankind whenever is goes astray from the right path of Truth

                            Mystery Of Khawaja Saheb’s Death

                            On the night of 5th of Rajab 634 AH the great saint as usual, retired to his cell after the
                            ‘Isha’ prayer (the prescribed time of this prayer is between 8-30 p.m. and midnight) and
                            closed the door, instructing his attending devotees not to disturb him that night. They
                            stayed away but heard a noise of something like ‘wajd’ (ecstasy) throughout that particular
                            night. In the early hours of the morning, this noise however ceased. When as usual, the door
                            of the cell did not open at the time of the morning prayers (5 to 6am), anxiety was felt all
                            round and ultimately it was forced open by Khawaja Saheb’s devotees. Their great saint had
                            relinquished his mortal remains and the following sentence in Arabic was radiantly
                            glittering on his forehead:

                            “Haaza Habib-Allah Mata Fee Hoob-Allah”
                            (He is God’s beloved and he died in God’s love)

                            Political Scenario

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Indian Political Scenario

                            The political scenario of India, before Hazrat Khawaja Muinuddin’s arrival, was such that he
                            had to face insurmountably difficulties against all sorts of opposition immediately after
                            his arrival in Delhi. It was not Raja Prithviraj alone who stubbornly resisted the entry and
                            stay of Khawaja Sahib of Ajmer. In the preceding centuries also when Muslim visitors came to
                            India and endeavoured to spread the light of Islam, they had to encounter tough opposition
                            in various forms.

                            As the early Muslims did not come with a missionary zeal or the spirit of a ‘world
                            movement’, the ephemeral success of Islam was short-lived because they came to conquer and
                            exploit the land. Moreover, the original impetus of the Islamic movement had been spent out
                            when the Ghaznavi, Lodi and Ghauri conquerors tried to establish their rule in India. But
                            Islamic history records in golden letters that the everlasting spirit of Islam was
                            instituted in India only by Khawaja Muinuddin Chishty and no one else. While the early Arabs
                            were true representatives of Islam, the latter Muslims from the North were actuated to
                            conquer the Indian States and not the hearts of the Indian people. The Khawaja Sahib had no
                            armies and did not come to conquer any Indian territory he conquered the hearts of the
                            Indian people, a grand spiritual victory that must stand high among all the political
                            victories of the world. No single person has ever performed such a marvelous miracle. It was
                            the ” Will” of God.

                            To achieve such a unique victory a new approach was necessary and this was given by Khawaja
                            Muinuddin’s mission and was altogether different from all previous and subsequent attempts.
                            He did not come to India with the object of political exploitation or rule. He came to
                            deliver the simple message of ” Peace and Love”. As enjoyed by Islam as a God’s missionary
                            with a view to endear the hearts of the Indian people for a world movement. And he succeeded
                            triumphantly because of his own inherent spiritual strength and the characteristic qualities
                            of Islam in spite of all the bitter and mighty opposition. There was thus a great difference
                            between Khawaja Sahib’s pious mission and the peaceful way of his approach and the ways of
                            the other Muslim conquerors or invaders who came to India before or after him.

                            History shows that in the early period of Islam (34 AH to 400 AH) or long before Khawaja
                            Sahib’s mission, Islam had already reached India through the Arab traders and travelers who
                            used to visit the western coast. In 200 AH. a Raja of Malabar is also reported to have
                            embraced Islam. Prior to this, Sind had already been conquered in 93 AH by one of the
                            emissaries of the Caliph of Islam. Later on, with the increasing Islamic influence in
                            Malabar and the simultaneous rise of Rajput power in Northern India, the Islamic influence
                            had faded gradually in the north. In any case the Indian rulers of that time were not
                            unmindful of the incursions of Islam in India and had continually been trying to check its
                            influence in this country.

                            Subuktagin, Mahmud. Jaipal

                            After the decline of the Abbasside and Saljuki Kingdoms, the distant provinces of Islamic
                            dominions had gradually become independent of the center and Naasiruddin Subuktagin a slave
                            of Sultan Alaptagin, had become the master of Ghazni. (977 to 997 AD)

                            With the appearance of Sultan Naasiruddin Subuktagin and his notorious son Sultan Mahmud on
                            the throne of Ghazni, the attention of the Hindu Rajas of India was diverted to the conquest
                            of Muslim territories in the North. By the middle of 400 AH they were so much encouraged by
                            their rising power that they wanted to conquer and bring even Afghanistan under their
                            suzerainty. When Raja Jaipal of Punjab took a lead to fulfil this ambitious scheme in 363AH,
                            he was naturally engaged in a defensive war by Subuktagin and was ultimately defeated and
                            captured. He however, escaped with the promise paying 1 lakh gold mohars and 50 elephants as
                            ransom. But immediately on reaching his capital, Lahore, he repudiated this pledge upon
                            which the Sultan was compelled to march on India in retaliation. This time Jaipal formed a
                            strong united front with the help of the rulers of Delhi, Ajmer, Kanauj and Kalahjar and
                            raised an army of 1 lakh with a very large number of foot soldiers. All this mighty force
                            however failed to win the war and Jaipal was once more captured. But the Raja again sought
                            his liberty and the magnanimous Sultan against set him free.

                            Jaipal’s Third Attack

                            After the death of Sultan Naasiruddin Subuktagin, Raja Jaipal thought he had great chance of
                            conquering Afghanistan. In 1001 AD he therefore, attacked again but was defeated and
                            arrested for the third time near Peshawar by Sultan Mahmud, son of Subuktagin. Jaipal
                            repeated the same old story of regret and he once again succeeded in securing his release.
                            But the moral affect of his three consecutive attacks and defeats was so heavy upon his
                            self-respect this time that he burned himself alive in a ‘Chita’ (pyre).

                            After Raja Jaipal’s death his son Raja Anandpal succeed him. He proved to be a haughtier
                            ruler than his father. Fired by old vigilance and hatred, he made an appeal to all his
                            brother princess of India to unite and support him in a crusade against Afghanistan’s ruler
                            in the name of ‘dhun, dharam and dharti’ (wealth, religion and land). On this propaganda, a
                            very large army relied under his banner and he started in 1003 AD via Peshawar to invade the
                            territory of the Sultan of Ghazni. Mahmud Ghaznavi was thus forced to defend his country
                            again and fought a furious war for 40 days. Anandpal was defeated and his allies deserted
                            him to be captured and brought up before the sultan. But the same old story of regret was
                            repeated once more. Like his father he also begged the Sultan to forgive on promise of
                            paying a ransom and the Sultan did set him free.

                            Whatever may be the verdict of historians against Mahmud Ghaznavi’s 17 notorious invasions
                            of India, the above historical facts of the repeated attacks against him and his father
                            should not be overlooked by all impartial observers when Mahmud is accused for his
                            intermittent invasions of India. The Sultan had no other alternative to safeguard his own
                            kingdom except adopting the policy of a curious strategy of a campaign of regular invasions
                            over India form 1003 to 1026 AD in order to keep his adversaries at bay, and in a state of
                            constant confusion and insecurity. This was his defensive policy.

                            Rajput Rivalries

                            Just before Khawaja Moiunddin’s arrival in India in 1191 AD this country was divided into
                            various smaller states which were ruled by different Rajput clans. Rajputana was under the
                            Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar, Ajmer was ruled by the Chauhans. Delhi was under Tomars, Kanauj
                            was ruled by Rathors, Gujarat by Baghelas, Bundelkand by Chandellas and Bengal and Bihar by
                            Paul and Sen dynasties respectively.

                            Among the above principalities, Kanauj and Delhi were most powerful but there existed a
                            bitter enmity between Raja Prithvi Raj (ruler of Ajmer and Delhi) and Raja Jaychand Rathor
                            (ruler of Kanauj). They were cousin brothers by blood relation. Raja Anandpal of Delhi was
                            their grandfather on maternal side. Jaychand was the son of Raja Anandpal’s elder daughter
                            and Prithviraj was the son of his younger daughter. Raja Anandpal had no male issue. At the
                            time of this death, he nominated Prithviraj as his heir and successor to the throne of Delhi
                            as he was both brave and handsome. This naturally enraged Jaychand who, by virtue of being
                            the son of the elder daughter of Raja Anandpal, claimed to be his rightful heir and
                            successor to the throne of Delhi.

                            Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan

                            Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan ruled from 1179 to 1192 AD. He was a legendary figure in the
                            Rajput history of India. He was the son of Raja Someshwara who ruled from 1169 to 1179 A D
                            over a big northern part of India. Raja Somdshwara was the 29th ruler in the lineage of Raja
                            Vasudeva who descended form Chahuman the founder of the “Chauhan” clan of Rajputs whose date
                            is untraceable. Raja Vasudeva is however reported to have flourished in Vikram Samvat 608 or
                            551 AD according to the genealogical tree given at the end of Prabhandakosh.

                            Emperor Prithvi Raj was the last Hindu Emperor of India who ruled over a mighty empire from
                            Taragarh Fort of Ajmer and Delhi. He enjoyed the unique distinction of being the “flower of
                            Rajput chivalry and human beauty” of his time. His famous bard, Chand has described his
                            heroic exploits and romantic career in “Prithvi Raj Rasa ,” a very rare but historic
                            documentary on the contemporary history of Rajputs in India.

                            It was during the reign of this emperor Prithvi Raj that Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty
                            arrived in Ajmer on his holy mission in 1191 AD. The Khawaja Sahib had to resist all the
                            stubborn opposition of Prithvi Raj with his amazing spiritual powers.

                            Why Ajmer

                            Apart from the 4606 recorded and unrecorded ‘Karamaat’ or miracles emanating from Hazrat
                            Khawaja Moinuddin the choice of Ajmer for the center of his spiritual mission was itself a
                            most remarkable feature of his illuminating work in India. It was not the work of any human
                            brain or ingenuity, but it was indeed the result of a “divine decree” from Medina or the
                            Holy Prophet of Islam that suited the great saint’s mission so admirably from every
                            conceivable point of its vantage. Politically Ajmer was the pivot of a mighty kingdom that
                            swayed over the most prominent part of India. Geographically it was the heart of India from
                            which the life blood flowed through all the vital veins of the country and socially and
                            economically it was at the zenith of Hindu superiority and power during the time of Khawaja
                            Sahib’s arrival in India. There could, therefore be no other suitable place for the seat of
                            his spiritual mission and to pilot the movement of Islam in this country. In short, it was
                            an ideal center from every point of view to conduct one of the toughest encounters between
                            the forces of materialism and spiritualism the world has ever witnessed in which the latter
                            as always, triumphed over the former by the infinite grace of God without recourse to any
                            kind of armed conflict, pressure or coercion.

                            Descendant & Khadims

                            Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Descendants and `Khadims’

                            History & Geneological Trace

                            According to the authentic historical sources it is evident that a small batch of the pious
                            followers had escorted Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty on his Indian mission. Their number
                            is said to be around 40, but one of them was certainly Hazrat Khawaja Syed Fakhruddin Ahmad
                            Gurdezi (R.A.) also known as Maulana Ahmad.

                            When Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin proceeded for India, his Peer – o – Murshid (spiritual mentor)
                            Hazrat Khawaja Usman Haruni asked him to take one of his blood relations and follower,
                            Hazrat Khawaja Fakhruddin Gurdezi (R.A.) along with him. Hazrat Khawaja Syed Fakhruddin
                            Gurdezi, the khadim – e- khas used to attend on Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty (R.A.) day
                            in and out, therefore, he and his descendants the present khadim community took pride and
                            deemed it an honour to be called “KHADIM”of Hazrat Khawaja Ghareeb Nawaz (R.A.).

                            Syed Fakhrudin stayed with the great Khawaja upto his last breath and when Khawaja Sahib
                            kept himself busy in prayer and meditation or in seclusion for a number of days he looked
                            after his affairs and management of Khangah and Langar Khana. Hazrat Syed Fakhruddin Gurdezi
                            (R.A.) died at Ajmer, on 25th of Rajab 642 A.H./1245 (nearly a decade after the “Wissal”
                            (death) of Hazrat Khawaja Gharib Nawaz (R.A.) and was buried near Mazar – e- Pak of Khawaja
                            Saheb in the Hujra, which is known as “Tosh – e- Khana” (Toshak – Khana). His annual Urs is
                            celebrated on the 25th of Rajab, with all religious ceremonies by the Khuddam, Khawaja Saheb
                            (Syedzadgan).

                            The khuddam of khawaja Sahib known as “Syedzaddgan” trace their descent from Hazrat Khawaja
                            Syed Fakhruddin Gurdezi (R.A.) through his sons. Khawaja Syed Masood, Khawaja Syed Mahoob
                            Bahlol and Khawaja Syed Ibrahim. Thus the ‘Khadims’ are performing their religious duties as
                            their fore – fathers had done in the past.

                            They served the Mazar – e- Pak (Shrine) and pray also on behalf of those unable to come to
                            Ajmer and have faith in Khawaja Sahib and are desirous of obtaining his blessings. Their
                            rights to serve the Shrine, to perform religious rituals and arrange spiritual functions and
                            to receive all kinds of Nazar are hereditary and have also been judicially recognised. The
                            documentary evidence in the “Malfoozat” (Sayings) of Chishtia order and historical
                            literature, Shahi Faramin, Sanads etc. (imperial orders) Jagirs, honours and rewards
                            conferred upon them from time to time not only by Muslim Rulers but also by many Hindu Rajas
                            and Chieftains of India, which was also conferred by the British Government during their
                            succeeding regimes indicate that they are the real custodians of the Shrine, as the whole
                            management, control of all the affairs, inside the tomb (Gumbad Mubrak) of the Shrine, are
                            exclusively in their hands. Although the Khadims have faced a number of revolutions and
                            changes of Government, but under all circumstances and worst political upheavals they kept
                            themselves attached to the Shrine and performed all their traditional duties and services.
