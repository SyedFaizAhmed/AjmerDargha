                        Necessity of Religion

                        Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Necessity of Religion

                        In this 20th century, new scientific inventions and political theories are causing irreparable
                        deterioration in the religious faith of mankind. Public mind is too much engrossed in these
                        attractions and man is getting away farther and farther from religion and God. The force of the
                        ‘matter’ overwhelmingly dominates the influence of the ‘spirit’. People are being torn away by
                        ideological warfare from their religious moorings and are left to drift astray, creating all
                        sorts of new troubles and miseries in an already much tormented world. The solutions sought
                        through man-made laws, against the time honoured and irrefutable religious laws and traditions
                        give little or no solace to the afflicted mankind. It seems that the world is fast drifting
                        towards religious bankruptcy.

                        Bonds Of Religion

                        What is religion? Of all the forces that have been working for the emancipation of mankind ever
                        since its origin, nothing is more potently powerful than the manifestation of those forces which
                        form religion. In spite of all the vicissitudes of time, that peculiar force is still visible in
                        the back ground of all our social, economic and political systems. It has been the greatest
                        cohesive impulse for the unity of mankind. In many cases the bonds of religion have proved
                        stronger than the bonds of climate, race and descent. People of the same family and descent.

                        Beginning Of Religion

                        The result of all ancient explorations to trace out the origin of religion shows that it is
                        ‘something’ super-human or supernatural and that its genesis is not in the human brain but it
                        has originated ‘somewhere else’. The theories are advanced about this analysis. One group
                        maintains ancestor worship as the origin of religion, while the other thinks that it originates
                        in the personification of the powers of Nature. A study of the ancient religions of the
                        Babylonians, Chinese, Egyptians and some American races reveal traces of ancestor worship as the
                        beginning of religion.

                        Ancestor Worship

                        The Egyptians believed in two souls, one of the external body and the other of the internal soul
                        that motivates it. They thought, when a man died, his ‘double’— the internal soul went out but
                        still lived, and it lasted so long as the ‘dead body’ was preserved intact. That is why they
                        preserved their dead and built huge pyramids over them. They thought if the ‘body’ was hurt its
                        double’ would also be injured. This was ancestor worship. The ancient Babylonians believed in
                        the same idea of ‘double’ but with slight variations. They believed that the ‘double’ lost all
                        sense of love; it even frightened the living to give if food and drink and so on. Among the
                        ancient Hindus too, traces of ancestor worship are found. The Chinese were also ancestor
                        worshippers. Thus the theory of ancestor-worship as the beginning of religion is strengthened by
                        one school of thought.

                        Nature Worship

                        According to the other theory, religion is said to have originated in nature worship as the
                        ancient Aryans maintained. The human mind has always been inquisitive and curious to find out
                        the philosophy behind the sun, the moon, the earth and the heavens, the stars, the hurricane and
                        so many other stupendous forces of nature and its beauties. It has tried to understand these
                        phenomena to which it attributes souls and bodies with something transcended. The result of all
                        investigations culminates in ‘abstractions’ whether personalised or not. The ancient Greeks also
                        followed this ‘nature worship’. Their mythology proves their ‘abstracted nature worship’. The
                        ancient Germans, Scandinavians and other Aryan races also followed the Greeks. All this makes a
                        strong case to show that religion had its origin in the personification of the “powers of
                        Nature”.

                        Spiritual Kingdom

                        A third theory which some of the highly learned people think to be the real origin of
                        `organised’ religion. It is known to be the “struggle” to transcend the limitation of the
                        sense”, whether man seeks to worship the dead spirits of his ancestors or tries to understand
                        the limitations of the senses. And yet he does not seem to be satisfied with this alone but
                        wants to investigate further. His search for the `Truth’ about these phenomena has continued
                        through all ages till he could assert a definite state of things called `ecstasy’ or inspiration
                        which we find in all the `organised’ religions of the world.

                        All Lead To One Goal

                        The prophets, the rishis, the saints, and the Sufis, all have discovered these ‘hidden’ facts
                        according to their own experiences and findings. All the principal religions of the world claim
                        that human mind has been able to transcend both the “limits of senses” and” the limits of
                        reason” with this peculiar power of transcending which they put forward as “a statement of
                        Facts”.

                        Finite And ‘Infinite’

                        Every human being seems to be struggling for an ‘Infinite power’ or an infinite pleasure, if we
                        may call it so but only a few have realised that this,‘infinite power’ or the infinite pleasure
                        is not to be had through senses which are too limited to understand and explain the ‘Infinite’.
                        As a matter of fact,‘Infinite’cannot be expressed through finite. Sooner or later man is
                        compelled to give up the finite and this state is called ‘renunciation’ which as its root in the
                        ethics, or say, Ethics stand on renunciation..

                        Philosophy Of Ethics

                        Ethics always says “Not I, but thou”, “Not Self but Non self” the laws of ethics demand that in
                        the search of “Infinite Power of Pleasure” selfish individualism to which man clings so
                        stubbornly, must be given up altogether. We must hold ourselves first, and all else last.”
                        Ethics say; we must hold ourselves last.

                        Ethical Laws

                        It thus follows that man has to give up the plane of ‘matter’ in his search for the ‘infinite’.
                        All ethical laws enjoin ‘self-abnegation or perfect self-annihilation’ as we have seen. But
                        people are surprised when they are asked to lose their selfish individualism because it is very
                        dear to them and is not an easy thing to be given up. And yet, at the same time, they declare
                        highest ideals of ethics to be right ignorant of the fact that the idea, the goal of all ethics,
                        is self-destruction and not the building up and sustenance of a selfish individualism

                        Role Of Sufi Saints

                        Those who have straightened the curly tail of the sinful world from time to time have never been
                        politicians or statesmen. They have always been the founders and reforms of great religions
                        endowed with “supernatural” powers to overcome even the mightiest forces of evil. Their
                        spiritual spark ignited the souls of millions. Such are the superhuman beings we always find in
                        the past history of mankind and shall continue to have them at appropriate periods in future
                        also despite all evolutions and revolutions of the world. There has always been a tussle between
                        spiritualism and materialism or between the spirit and the sword in which the former has always
                        vanquished the latter. While the holy founders and teachers of great religions, acting as
                        apostles of God, tried to establish righteousness and peace on earth, the worshippers of evil
                        have furiously defied them in order to retain their own temporal supremacy. But history repeats
                        itself and the struggle between the two still goes on.

                        Religion And Human Character

                        Religion is the greatest motive power for building up a virtuous human character for achieving
                        everything that is good and beneficial to mankind and for bringing peace and happiness to the
                        afflicted souls including one’s own self.

                        His Ethical Sayings

                        Gharibnawaz(R.A) >His Ethical Sayings Gems of Wisdom

                        Here are some of the sacred sayings of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin. The intervening period of seven
                        long centuries has not, in any way, affected their ever-lasting efficacy and value.

                        Essence of Sufism

                        The heart of a lover (the true devote of God) constantly burns with the fire of Love so much so
                        that whatever passion intrudes upon its sanctity is burnt to ashes.
                        He indeed is a true devotee blessed with the love of God, who is gifted with the following three
                        attributes: river-like charity, i.e his sense of charity has no limits and is equally beneficial
                        to all the creatures of God who approach him, Sun-like affection, i.e. his affection may be
                        extended indiscriminately to all like sunlight and Earth-like hospitality, i.e. His loving
                        embrace may be open to all like that of the earth.
                        A sin committed does not harm an individual so much as the looking down with contempt upon one’s
                        own fellow beings.
                        The test of a true devotee’s mind is that it is always, and to all intents, strictly obedient to
                        the will of God and is constantly afraid of behaving in a manner which is apt to displease Him
                        resulting in the withdrawal of His grace.
                        A seer of the ‘essence of things’ is characteristically mute and meditative.
                        He is a hardened sinner who commits sin and yet simultaneously entertains the belief that he is
                        one the God’s ‘chosen few’.
                        A Dervish or hermit is one who would never disappoint a needy.
                        Patience is tested through resignation to sorrow, sufferings and disaster without a murmur
                        disclosing one’s pains to others.
                        The more one learns about the ‘essence of things’ the more he wonders.
                        The seer regards Death as a friend, luxury as a enemy and the constant narration or remembrance
                        of God as a glory.
                        The best time for the seer of dervish is indicated by the absence of all cares from his mind.
                        Knowledge is comprised upto an unfathomable ocean and enlightenment is like a wave in it, then
                        what is the relation of God and man ? While the ocean of knowledge is sustained by God alone,
                        the enlightenment pertains to man.
                        ‘Namaaz’ (Islamic prayer) is the ladder leading to the proximity of God Almighty.
                        Prosperity departs from the home of one who tells a lie on oath and he is soon ruined.
                        The graveyard is the place for picking up a lesson. In such a solemn surrounding, one should not
                        indulge in laughing or burst into laughter or eat or drink or do any other worldly thing.
                        Keep handy your equipment for the last journey and think of death as hovering over your head at
                        all times.
                        God rains misfortune and misery upon the heads of those whom He loves.
                        The best way of evading the fire of hell lies in feeding the hungry, providing water to the
                        thirsty, removing the wants of the needy and befriending the miserable.
                        Just as the sunshine increases gradually in the morning so does the Divine Light expands in one
                        who says Ishraaq prayers.
                        When the Aarif meditates over a thing, he attains a state of absorption in which even if
                        thousands of angels assuming wonderful forms try to attract him, he would remain entirely
                        undisturbed for the time being.
                        There is impurity below every human hair, hence water must touch and reach the root of every
                        hair. If a single hair shall remain dirty, purification is not complete and is impaired.
                        Human Perspiration is not impure (Hadith).
                        Offer your repentance quickly before death arrives and hurry up to perform the Namaaz before its
                        final hour passes.
                        It is incumbent on the followers of the path of ‘Tariqat’ (the path leading to Divinity) that he
                        must first divorce or renounce the physical world, and then the second world thereafter and
                        ultimately his own ‘self’ (Nafs) when alone he can pursue his right path, failing which he
                        should abandon the enterprise of Sufism.
                        For a follower of the path of Truth, it is worse than a sin to disdain or look down upon any
                        one.
                        When the Aarif becomes silent it means that he is talking to God, and when he closes his eyes it
                        means that he his knocking at God’s door
                        The path of Love (of God) is such a path that whoever stepped into it, he lost himself.
                        Those devoted to the path of the ‘knowledge of God’s realisation’ (Irfaan ) have nothing to
                        speak of except God.
                        Severance of connection with wealth and property is one of the inferior achievements of an
                        Aarif.
                        Those who are true lovers of God, give away both of the worlds for the sake of their ‘beloved’
                        and even then they feel that they have done nothing whatever.
                        Verily he is an Aarif who is clothed with three qualities-firstly, piety; secondly, conduct
                        eliciting respect, and thirdly, modesty.
                        Love of God transcends and is above all passion for others.
                        Perfection of Faith is evidenced by three things – Fear, Hope and Love.
                        Death is a bridge which expands the passage for a lover to reach his beloved (God).
                        True Friendship or love (of God) lies in maintaining His constant recollection in heart and not
                        in expression by speech.
                        The heart was essentially created for making rounds of the love of God.
                        Sama-Qawwali

                        Gharibnawaz(R.A) >Sama’ (Qawwali)

                        Origin And Conception

                        The root of the word Qawwali is Qa’ol which is an Arabic word meaning an axiom or dictum based
                        upon the religious subjects which help purification of thoughts. From the word Qawwali we also
                        get another word Qawwali which means a musician or singer who sings the hymns or praises of God
                        and dictums of the prophets, saints and other holy personages in Arabic, Persian, Urdu and even
                        Hindustani composed by reputed Sufi saints and poets. These Qawwali concerts are magnetic in
                        nature and touch the delicate cord of human heart which, being ethereal, is the main centre of
                        spiritual awakening in man. The Khawaja Sahib not only introduced but also patronised these
                        concerts to capture and mould the hearts of his audience for accepting the Divine Message
                        gracefully.

                        Music has always played a prominent part in the religious and social life of India from time
                        immemorial and therefore singing or recital of the devotional songs called bhajans etc. has been
                        one of the important ceremonials at Hindu temples and religious congregations. The Khawaja Sahib
                        was the inventor of the fascinating blending of sweet songs in Sufistic style preaching the
                        gospel of Truth. This medium suited Indian culture, temperament, customs and traditions most
                        admirably with the result that his Sama or Qawwali mahfils (congregations) became very popular
                        with good results and they continue to be so even to this day.

                        Language Of Qawwali

                        While the devotional songs offered at Hindu shrine are composed in Sanskrit, Hindi or other
                        regional languages of India, the compositions sung at the Qawwali mahfils are generally a choice
                        selection of inspiring religious poetry in Persian by various reputed Sufi poets and dervishes.
                        To soften and capture a human heart, possessing even the slightest spark of piety and devotion,
                        the appeal of such Qawwali concerts has been amazingly irresistible. They have sort of hypnotic
                        influence upon spiritual-minded audience inspiring a kind of uncontrollable jazba (intense
                        feeling) culminating in wajd or ecstasy.

                        Qualification of a Qawwal

                        A perfect Qawwal is one who is the master of classical Indian music gifted with a sweet and
                        fascinating voice on the one hand, and is thoroughly conversant with the variety of selective
                        poetical compositions on Sufism by distinguished Persian, Urdu and Hindi poets on the other. In
                        addition to many years’ hard practice consistent with the varied knowledge of the said poetry, a
                        really good Qawwal still needs the “spiritual blessings” of any great Sufi saint for his
                        ultimate perfection and general recognition. There are many instances of excellent Qawwals who
                        have risen to frame and fortune under the blessings of one or the other Sufi saint in India
