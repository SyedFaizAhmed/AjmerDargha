                        Nizam Gate

                        Mir Osman Ali Khan, The Nizam of Hyderabad Deccan, erected the main gate of the Dargah Sharif in
                        1911.

                        High entrance that was erected by Mahmood Khilji or one of his successors. Before the
                        commencement of Urs Sharif a flag is hoisted on top of this gate with grand ceremony on the 25th
                        Jamadiulsaani for ushering the ‘Urs’ of Khawaja Saheb, which starts from 1st of Rajab (The 7th
                        month of lunar Calendar)

                        ——————————————————————————–
                        Degs

                        On either side of the second Baland Darwaza in front of Saham Chiragh (courtyard lamp), there
                        are two huge Degs (cauldrons for cooking food) fixed into solid masonry in which a palatable
                        mixture of rice sugar, ghee (butter) and dried fruits is cooked for distribution to the public
                        as tabarruk.

                        The circumference at the edge of the larger cauldron is 10-1/4 feet. It cooks 70 mounds of rice,
                        while the smaller Deg takes 28 mounds. One of them was presented by Akbar in 1567 A.D. The
                        princes or the well-to-do pilgrims order these Degs to be cooked generally during the Urs period

                        Mahfilkhana

                        On the west of the Saham Chiragh stands the magnificent building of Samakhana or Mahfilkhana
                        (auditorium with darbar hall) which was built by Nawab Bashir-ud-Dowla Sir Asmaan Jah of
                        Hyderabad Deccan in 1888-91 A.D. This spacious hall is 46 feet square with a gallery of 14 feet
                        running around it.

                        It is used for 6 days only during the annual Urs for religious ‘Mahfils’ in which Qawwali is the
                        chief item of programme commencing at 11 P.M. and ending with Fatiha (a relifious ceremony) in

                        ——————————————————————————–

                        Begami Daalaan

                        Overhanging the principal eastern to the Shrine or Mausoleum, there is a handsome porch known as
                        Begami Daalaan which was built in 1643 AD by Princess Jahan Ara Begam, the favorite daughter of
                        Emperor Shah Jahan.

                        The walls and the beautiful marble pillars of the Begami Daalaan were done in colorful gold in
                        1888 AD. Later on, the ceiling of this Daalaan was also embellished in gold with the money
                        donated by a Muslim merchant of Bombay. This beautiful portico was used by the Begams or ladies
                        of the Moghul harem during their frequent visits to the shrine.

                        ——————————————————————————–

                        There are two simultaneous entrances to the Shrine through the Begami Daalaan. The doors of both
                        of them are mounted with heavy silverplate carved in ornamental details. The tomb is of white
                        marble inlaid with pieces of precious stones and is daily bestrewed with sandal-paste and Itars
                        (perfumes). It is always covered with very costly ‘ghilaafs’ (coverings made of velvet and silk)
                        embroidered with pleasing gold and silver tracings.

                        Dargah Shrine

                        Over the tomb, there is a silver ‘chaparkhat’ (canopy) inlaid with pieces of mother-of-pearl
                        presented by Emperor Jahangir. Between the four poles supporting this `chaparkhat’, there is
                        silver `katehra’ (railing) with an arch towards the south. There is another outer silver katehra
                        running around the tomb at a distance of about 2 feet. The devotees are led into this space to
                        offer flowers and prayers over the tomb. The ceiling of the dome is covered by a costly velvet
                        chatgiri. A peculiar kind of fascinating aroma prevails in the shrine which inspires the
                        visitors with a spontaneous and irresistible urge for devotion and homage towards the asleep
                        saint. As soon as one enters the interior of the shrine, he feels as if he is in the presence of
                        some exalted soul or mighty spiritual king.

                        Mazar and offering fresh flowers.The second khidmat takes place at 3.00 p.m. At this time, all
                        pilgrims are permitted inside the Tomb except ladies. Now apart from offering flowers, khadims
                        recite Fateha and offer sandalwood which is also distributed among the pilgrims.

                        Lighting (Roshnee)

                        Fifteen minutes before evening prayer the ritual of Roshnee (lighting) takes place. It starts
                        with khudam bringing candles inside the Tomb with drums beating in the background. Once inside,
                        khadims place these candles in lamps and recite some Persian verse. Finally the lamps are placed
                        in the four corners of the Holy Tomb and are lighted.

                        Karka (Closing ceremony)

                        Karka is the closing ceremony of the Tomb which takes place after an hour of Isha prayer.
                        According to old custom, about 20 minutes before closing the door, when fifth part of the night
                        passes, a person calls to ring five, the clock sounds five times, the devotees present inside
                        the Tomb are requested to go out of the Shrine. Then three khadims clean and sweep the Tomb.
                        After that they come out of the Tomb and the bell rings six times. Immediately after that
                        Qawwals sing a special song called `Karka’. After the song is over, the entrance of the Tomb is
                        closed.

                        Langer

                        Dargah’s daily ceremony includes Langer (free distribution of food) where they serve wheat
                        porridge which is cooked in a special grass. This particular porridge is significant because
                        this is the same porridge that Khawaja Baba used to consume. It is said that when Emperor Akber
                        visited Khawaja Baba’s Mazar, he used to stand in queue and take the Langer like any other
                        ordinary man. The Langer takes place after Isha prayer (namaz)

                        Sama (Qawwali)

                        Every day in front of the main shrine (mazar), after fazar namaz, magrib namaz and Isha namaz,
                        there’s a mehfil-e-sama where devotional songs on Allah is sung by special Qawwals (devotional
                        singer).

                        Milad & Quran Recital

                        It’s a complete recital of the Holy Quran which takes place every day at Jama Masjid and Alamgir
                        Masjid.
